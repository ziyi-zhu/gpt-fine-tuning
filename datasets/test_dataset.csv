"Conrad said: ""It's them.  They did this.""
Nicholas said: ""It's a flat tire.  That's all.""
Conrad said: ""How do you know?""
Nicholas said: ""We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.""
Conrad said: ""Okay... okay."""
"Nicholas said: ""The phone's dead.""
Conrad said: ""Really?""
Nicholas said: ""Do you know how to change a tire?""
Conrad said: ""No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this."""
"Nicholas said: ""How did those... ?""
Conrad said: ""You're part of it...""
Nicholas said: ""What?  Connie..."""
"Conrad said: ""No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!""
Nicholas said: ""No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...""
Conrad said: ""You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!""
Nicholas said: ""Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?""
Conrad said: ""Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...""
Nicholas said: ""Stop this.  It's not true...""
Conrad said: ""I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?""
Nicholas said: ""Stop it!"""
"Nicholas said: ""You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...""
Conrad said: ""Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun."""
"Nicholas said: ""What?""
Conrad said: ""This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill."""
"Nicholas said: ""Really?""
Conrad said: ""Yeah.""
Nicholas said: ""Split it?""
Conrad said: ""Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.""
Nicholas said: ""Where's Christine?  The waitress.""
Conrad said: ""Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.""
Nicholas said: ""Did she?"""
"Counselor said: ""No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?""
Nicholas said: ""Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...""
Counselor said: ""It always is."""
"Nicholas said: ""What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...""
Counselor said: ""Robbed?""
Nicholas said: ""Yes.""
Counselor said: ""Have you gone to the police?""
Nicholas said: ""I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that."""
"Counselor said: ""We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?""
Nicholas said: ""Yes.""
Counselor said: ""And, they didn't take that watch?"""
"Counselor said: ""How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.""
Nicholas said: ""Yes, very lucky."""
"Nicholas said: ""I need your car, Elizabeth.""
Elizabeth said: ""What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...""
Nicholas said: ""I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.""
Elizabeth said: ""Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?"""
"Nicholas said: ""The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.""
Elizabeth said: ""There's nothing to forgive.""
Nicholas said: ""It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.""
Elizabeth said: ""Of course, Nick..."""
"Nicholas said: ""It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.""
Elizabeth said: ""Yes."""
"Nicholas said: ""I'll explain someday.""
Elizabeth said: ""I hope."""
"Elizabeth said: ""We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.""
Nicholas said: ""You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.""
Elizabeth said: ""Happy Birthday, Nicholas.""
Nicholas said: ""I'll call.  I really will.""
Elizabeth said: ""I know."""
"Feingold said: ""Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.""
Nicholas said: ""I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...""
Feingold said: ""Oh, here we go..."""
"Feingold said: ""V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...""
Nicholas said: ""What is?"""
"Feingold said: ""Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...""
Nicholas said: ""No, thank you.""
Feingold said: ""You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W...."""
"Feingold said: ""I don't write the questions.  I just review them.""
Nicholas said: ""What's all this for?""
Feingold said: ""We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...""
Nicholas said: ""No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?""
Feingold said: ""Oh... it's a game.""
Nicholas said: ""A game?""
Feingold said: ""Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.""
Nicholas said: ""What kind of vacation?""
Feingold said: ""It's different every time.""
Nicholas said: ""Humor me with specifics.""
Feingold said: ""We provide whatever's lacking.""
Nicholas said: ""And if nothing's lacking?""
Feingold said: ""May I make two suggestions... ?""
Nicholas said: ""Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?""
Feingold said: ""First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch."""
"Nicholas said: ""How long will these take?""
Feingold said: ""An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.""
Nicholas said: ""Physical?""
Feingold said: ""Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time."""
"Feingold said: ""Sorry to keep you waiting.""
Nicholas said: ""Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your ""crack team"".""
Feingold said: ""It's all down to this..."""
"Feingold said: ""One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.""
Nicholas said: ""You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?""
Feingold said: ""It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.""
Nicholas said: ""You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.""
Feingold said: ""That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist."""
"Nicholas said: ""Get rid of them.""
Feingold said: ""Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go..."""
"Feingold said: ""Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.""
Nicholas said: ""I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.""
Feingold said: ""Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!"""
"Feingold said: ""Goddamnit, why do they do that?""
Nicholas said: ""How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.""
Feingold said: ""They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor."""
"Nicholas said: ""They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.""
Feingold said: ""No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...""
Nicholas said: ""Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.""
Feingold said: ""What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous."""
"Nicholas said: ""Drive in.""
Feingold said: ""What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.""
Nicholas said: ""I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard."""
"Feingold said: ""You don't need me...""
Nicholas said: ""Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail."""
"Nicholas said: ""Where?""
Feingold said: ""I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.""
Nicholas said: ""Where'd you pick up your checks?""
Feingold said: ""It was a different floor then...""
Nicholas said: ""Guess!""
Feingold said: ""Like, this way... sort of..."""
"Nicholas said: ""I need the police.""
Girl said: ""Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below."""
"Nicholas said: ""You know, these fit... perfectly.""
Girl said: ""They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace."""
"Girl said: ""I've been so lonely.""
Nicholas said: ""I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.""
Girl said: ""Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.""
Nicholas said: ""Don't take another step."""
"Girl said: ""Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.""
Nicholas said: ""First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on."""
"Hotel Manager said: ""Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...""
Nicholas said: ""Have we met?"""
"Hotel Manager said: ""Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.""
Nicholas said: ""The key?""
Hotel Manager said: ""Hm?""
Nicholas said: ""Is there a room key?""
Hotel Manager said: ""Didn't I give you two?""
Nicholas said: ""No, you didn't..."""
"Nicholas said: ""Thank you.""
Ilsa said: ""Have a nice day."""
"Ilsa said: ""Dinner's in the oven.""
Nicholas said: ""Thank you.  Goodnight."""
"Ilsa said: ""You did?  How is he?""
Nicholas said: ""Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.""
Ilsa said: ""Well... send my love, if you see him again."""
"Ilsa said: ""Is everything alright?""
Nicholas said: ""Fine.""
Ilsa said: ""I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?""
Nicholas said: ""No, thank you.  Goodnight.""
Ilsa said: ""Goodnight then."""
"Ilsa said: ""Mr. Van Orton... ?""
Nicholas said: ""Ilsa... you're alright?""
Ilsa said: ""Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?""
Nicholas said: ""Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?""
Ilsa said: ""I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?""
Nicholas said: ""There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle."""
"Ilsa said: ""What makes you ask?""
Nicholas said: ""I'm not sure."""
"Ilsa said: ""All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.""
Nicholas said: ""He came to my mind recently, that's all."""
"Ilsa said: ""Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.""
Nicholas said: ""Was he morose, or...?  I mean...""
Ilsa said: ""No.  What happened... no one expected it.""
Nicholas said: ""Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.""
Ilsa said: ""Not much, I think.""
Nicholas said: ""I'm just like him.""
Ilsa said: ""You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.""
Nicholas said: ""Did you worry about him?""
Ilsa said: ""Nobody worried about your father."""
"Ilsa said: ""Goodnight.  See you home.""
Nicholas said: ""Goodnight.  Where was she?"""
"Nicholas said: ""What's the trouble?""
Manager said: ""You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager..."""
"Nicholas said: ""Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.""
Manager said: ""Your brother.  Will you come with me?""
Nicholas said: ""What's this about?""
Manager said: ""It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...""
Nicholas said: ""Where's my brother?"""
"Manager said: ""There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.""
Nicholas said: ""His behavior... ?""
Manager said: ""He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...""
Nicholas said: ""Look, where is he?!""
Manager said: ""There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone..."""

Maria said: ""I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?""
Nicholas said: ""Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it."""
"Maria said: ""Your ex-wife.""
Nicholas said: ""I know who she is.  Take a message."""
"Nicholas said: ""I don't like her.""
Maria said: ""I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...""
Nicholas said: ""What?""
Maria said: ""A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...""
Nicholas said: ""What gentleman, Maria?""
Maria said: ""A Mister... Seymour Butts."""

Nicholas said: ""Sam...  Thank you."""
"Nicholas said: ""He hasn't called back.""
Sutherland said: ""What about the house?"""
"Sutherland said: ""Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...""
Nicholas said: ""Attempted murder."""

Nicholas said: ""You warm my heart."""
"Todd said: ""Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.""
Luke said: ""Greetings fellow insomniac.""
Todd said: ""Greetings fellow sheep counter."""
"Todd said: ""These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?""
Luke said: ""It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?"""

Todd said: ""What?""
Luke said: ""<u>Every</u> year is a good year."""

Nell said: ""Uh... Nell Vance...""
Luke said: ""And what kind of sleeper?""
Nell said: ""Well, I... uh...""
Luke said: ""Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess..."""
"Nell said: ""I only saw Theo drive up.""
Luke said: ""Who's Watts?"""
"Nell said: ""The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.""
Luke said: ""Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist."""
"Nell said: ""Couldn't get the last ones.  You?""
Luke said: ""I did okay."""
"Nell said: ""Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?""
Luke said: ""It's somebody's idea of a joke."""
"Luke said: ""Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.""
Nell said: ""Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?"""
"Marrow said: ""And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.""
Luke said: ""Greetings."""
"Luke said: ""So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?""
Marrow said: ""I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company."""
"Luke said: ""That could have been worse.""
Marrow said: ""Yeah."""
"Marrow said: ""Luke, can I talk to you?""
Luke said: ""Sure.""
Marrow said: ""Because... well, I know I can trust you.""
Luke said: ""Why?""
Marrow said: ""I've read your tests."""
"Luke said: ""Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.""
Marrow said: ""Go ahead."""
"Marrow said: ""And those are Luke's and mine.""
Luke said: ""There's a carriage house around back."""

Luke said: ""Do we still get paid for the week?""
Marrow said: ""You get your money."""
"Luke said: ""Is that the question of compassion or science?""
Marrow said: ""It's a question.""
Luke said: ""She got the child labor stuff from me."""
"Luke said: ""It's not going to hold your weight.""
Marrow said: ""Just stay there, Nell!"""
"Luke said: ""You're not telling us something.""
Marrow said: ""Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here."""
"Theo said: ""The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.""
Luke said: ""Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --"""
"Luke said: ""He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.""
Theo said: ""And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck."""
"Luke said: ""Hey!  I heard screaming...""
Theo said: ""Luke."""
"Luke said: ""Well, this lot is full!""
Theo said: ""He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something."""
"Luke said: ""I didn't do it.""
Theo said: ""You could have.""
Luke said: ""So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?""
Theo said: ""No."""
"Theo said: ""Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?""
Luke said: ""The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else."""
"Theo said: ""We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.""
Luke said: ""You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?""
Theo said: ""That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.""
Luke said: ""All night?""
Theo said: ""Yeah.""
Luke said: ""You want company?""
Theo said: ""Maybe someday."""
"Luke said: ""You used the wrong test.""
Theo said: ""Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices."""
"Theo said: ""Nell --""
Luke said: ""-- how much is this car worth?"""
"Theo said: ""Was sure she'd be in here.""
Luke said: ""Where in the hell can she be."""

Luke said: ""We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found..."""
"Malcolm said: ""It's still an electric shock!""
Marrow said: ""Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration..."""
"Marrow said: ""Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.""
Malcolm said: ""And that will be a good place to end this study.""
Marrow said: ""No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...""
Malcolm said: ""Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!""
Marrow said: ""But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor."""
"Malcolm said: ""Are you working with her?""
Marrow said: ""Mary, I'll meet you outside."""
"Malcolm said: ""Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.""
Marrow said: ""And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.""
Malcolm said: ""You don't believe in the paranormal.""
Marrow said: ""No, but she does, and that's all that matters.""
Malcolm said: ""Does she know that's why you're using her?""
Marrow said: ""No.""
Malcolm said: ""I, I just can't...""
Marrow said: ""She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.""
Malcolm said: ""I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.""
Marrow said: ""This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science."""
"Marrow said: ""Eleanor, how was the drive?""
Nell said: ""You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.""
Marrow said: ""Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.""
Nell said: ""I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.""
Marrow said: ""Well... we're glad to have you."""
"Marrow said: ""You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.""
Nell said: ""Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you."""
"Nell said: ""All the carvings.""
Marrow said: ""But there's a sad catch to the story."""
"Marrow said: ""The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?""
Nell said: ""Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?""
Marrow said: ""How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?"""
"Nell said: ""Sorry.""
Marrow said: ""For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry..."""
"Marrow said: ""Nell!  What's wrong?""
Nell said: ""That smell... oh, God."""
"Marrow said: ""What did it smell like?""
Nell said: ""It was very specific.""
Marrow said: ""All right...""
Nell said: ""In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.""
Marrow said: ""So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.""
Nell said: ""I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.""
Marrow said: ""What happened after you smelled it?""
Nell said: ""I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.""
Marrow said: ""Like she smelled it too?""
Nell said: ""Yes.""
Marrow said: ""And then what happened?""
Nell said: ""I got more scared."""
"Marrow said: ""Hmm.""
Nell said: ""I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.""
Marrow said: ""No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something."""
"Nell said: ""Are you coming to confess?""
Marrow said: ""I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up."""
"Nell said: ""Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?""
Marrow said: ""I don't know.""
Nell said: ""It was a stupid thing to do.""
Marrow said: ""It was.""
Nell said: ""Welcome Home.""
Marrow said: ""You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?""
Nell said: ""Sure."""
"Marrow said: ""Someone is playing with you.""
Nell said: ""Why?""
Marrow said: ""I don't know.""
Nell said: ""It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer."""
"Marrow said: ""What is that tune?""
Nell said: ""I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?"""
"Marrow said: ""Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...""
Nell said: ""And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!"""
"Marrow said: ""I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.""
Nell said: ""It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?"""
"Marrow said: ""Why would we want to do that, Nell?""
Nell said: ""Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!"""
"Nell said: ""The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.""
Marrow said: ""Nell.  You will come here now."""
"Nell said: ""But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!""
Marrow said: ""Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.""
Nell said: ""Then who called me?"""
"Marrow said: ""No.""
Nell said: ""My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her."""
"Marrow said: ""Come on.""
Nell said: ""No --"""
"Marrow said: ""What'll happen to us, Nell?""
Nell said: ""Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please."""
"Mary said: ""You know what he's really upset about?""
Marrow said: ""What?""
Mary said: ""You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?"""
"Marrow said: ""You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.""
Mary said: ""Test it."""
"Marrow said: ""Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.""
Mary said: ""How'd I know it was for you?""
Marrow said: ""Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you."""
"Mary said: ""Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.""
Marrow said: ""Good."""
"Mary said: ""What's this?  What's this... this picture?""
Marrow said: ""That?  That's Hill House.""
Mary said: ""This is where we're going?""
Marrow said: ""Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?"""
"Mary said: ""What happened?""
Marrow said: ""There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken."""
"Marrow said: ""Have either of you seen David Watts?""
Theo said: ""No, but Nell's been here longer than I have."""
"Theo said: ""When do we take the tests?""
Marrow said: ""Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening."""
"Theo said: ""Well this is a cozy breakfast.""
Marrow said: ""Good morning, Theo.  Luke."""
"Theo said: ""Maybe they're Mary's.""
Marrow said: ""Mary came with me."""
"Marrow said: ""Get a blanket!""
Theo said: ""It's okay... we're all here..."""
"Marrow said: ""Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.""
Theo said: ""How could you do this to people?"""
"Marrow said: ""Is she asleep?""
Theo said: ""Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night."""
"Theo said: ""She needs help.""
Marrow said: ""I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal."""
"Theo said: ""He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.""
Marrow said: ""No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell."""
"Theo said: ""Oh God, we can't get out!""
Marrow said: ""Nell, what do we do?"""
"Theo said: ""I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?""
Marrow said: ""I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.""
Theo said: ""But the experiment was a failure."""
"Mr. Dudley said: ""What do you want?""
Nell said: ""Oh!  You scared me.""
Mr. Dudley said: ""Me?  No.  What are you doing here?""
Nell said: ""Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?""
Mr. Dudley said: ""Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?""
Nell said: ""I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?"""
"Nell said: ""Why do you need a chain like that?""
Mr. Dudley said: ""That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?"""
"Nell said: ""Is there something about the house?""
Mr. Dudley said: ""Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you."""
"Mr. Dudley said: ""That's where she hanged herself.""
Nell said: ""Who?""
Mr. Dudley said: ""Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it."""
"Nell said: ""Why?""
Mr. Dudley said: ""Why'd she kill herself?""
Nell said: ""Yes.""
Mr. Dudley said: ""She was unhappy.""
Nell said: ""Why?""
Mr. Dudley said: ""Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work."""
"Mrs. Dudley said: ""It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.""
Nell said: ""Mrs. Dudley.""
Mrs. Dudley said: ""So far."""
"Nell said: ""They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?""
Mrs. Dudley said: ""I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.""
Nell said: ""Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here."""
"Mrs. Dudley said: ""It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.""
Nell said: ""Why would we --""
Mrs. Dudley said: ""-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark."""
"Mrs. Dudley said: ""No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.""
Nell said: ""No one will come any nearer than that."""
"Theo said: ""And what you're wearing, that's great, too.""
Nell said: ""This?  It's from a thrift shop.""
Theo said: ""What did it cost?""
Nell said: ""Fifteen dollars.""
Theo said: ""That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!""
Nell said: ""It's all I could afford.""
Theo said: ""Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?""
Nell said: ""I don't know what you mean."""
"Theo said: ""Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.""
Nell said: ""That's why we're here.""
Theo said: ""What do you do?""
Nell said: ""I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?""
Theo said: ""That depends."""
"Nell said: ""Not really.""
Theo said: ""Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.""
Nell said: ""Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.""
Theo said: ""My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?""
Nell said: ""No.""
Theo said: ""A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?""
Nell said: ""I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor."""
"Theo said: ""Jeez.""
Nell said: ""I know."""
"Nell said: ""I love this house.  I really love this house.""
Theo said: ""You're okay."""
"Nell said: ""A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.""
Theo said: ""The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?"""
"Theo said: ""You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?""
Nell said: ""Yes.  I've missed it.""
Theo said: ""No.  The world has missed you."""
"Nell said: ""Good night, Theo.""
Theo said: ""You, too.  Happy tossing and turning."""
"Theo said: ""If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.""
Nell said: ""You know it wasn't a joke, Theo."""
"Nell said: ""Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?""
Theo said: ""I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good."""
"Nell said: ""How could he have left without his keys?""
Theo said: ""Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his."""
"Theo said: ""Watts?""
Nell said: ""What's his first name?""
Theo said: ""David.""
Nell said: ""David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!"""
"Nell said: ""David?""
Theo said: ""Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside."""
"Theo said: ""Is it over?""
Nell said: ""No, it's getting worse."""
"Nell said: ""Theo... Did you?""
Theo said: ""Maybe you did it yourself.""
Nell said: ""Why?""
Theo said: ""I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it..."""
"Theo said: ""That's so sad.""
Nell said: ""There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.""
Theo said: ""Before he painted your name over Mister Crain."""
"Theo said: ""Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.""
Nell said: ""I don't know what to think anymore.""
Theo said: ""Just think about one thing right now: What color?"""
"Nell said: ""I've never had a pedicure before.""
Theo said: ""Well?""
Nell said: ""Red.  What else?"""
"Nell said: ""I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.""
Theo said: ""Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch."""
"Nell said: ""I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?""
Theo said: ""I have a loft."""
"Theo said: ""You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?""
Nell said: ""I don't know, you know..."""
"Theo said: ""My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?""
Nell said: ""I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things."""
"Theo said: ""Are you sure?""
Nell said: ""I think so.""
Theo said: ""Okay."""
"Theo said: ""Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --""
Nell said: ""-- What do you think?"""
"Theo said: ""Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.""
Nell said: ""Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is."""
"Theo said: ""Nell, what happened?""
Nell said: ""Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --"""
"Nell said: ""This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!""
Theo said: ""Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.""
Nell said: ""-- but the painting!"""
"Theo said: ""I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.""
Nell said: ""I don't think I want any.""
Theo said: ""I do."""
"Nell said: ""They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!""
Theo said: ""Come on!  Why are we waiting?"""
"Theo said: ""What'd you come back for, babe?""
Nell said: ""Just had to be sure."""
"Nell said: ""Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.""
Theo said: ""Then let's go get you one."""
"Valentine said: ""Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.""
Adhara said: ""I used to hate it.  Now I like it.""
Valentine said: ""Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum."""
"Valentine said: ""Is there anything in the world that you want or need?""
Adhara said: ""I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.""
Valentine said: ""Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.""
Adhara said: ""Then what good is he?""
Valentine said: ""Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?""
Adhara said: ""Is that a problem?""
Valentine said: ""Not for you, clearly.""
Adhara said: ""I'm loyal to things that make me happy.""
Valentine said: ""Am I a thing?""
Adhara said: ""Well, you're certainly not a person.""
Valentine said: ""I'm not.""
Adhara said: ""No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.""
Valentine said: ""I'm so glad we're having this chat.""
Adhara said: ""It's not a knock.""
Valentine said: ""It's not a compliment.""
Adhara said: ""It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?""
Valentine said: ""As soon as you get dressed.""
Adhara said: ""What kind of food?""
Valentine said: ""Anything but Japanese.""
Adhara said: ""Why?""
Valentine said: ""I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.""
Adhara said: ""Like you.""
Valentine said: ""I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.""
Adhara said: ""You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.""
Valentine said: ""It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.""
Adhara said: ""For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.""
Valentine said: ""That's what Gordon's always saying.""
Adhara said: ""Oh, god."""
"Adhara said: ""Italian?""
Valentine said: ""I'm sorry.""
Adhara said: ""Italian.""
Valentine said: ""Who?""
Adhara said: ""Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.""
Valentine said: ""Sure."""
"Adhara said: ""I like the colors.""
Valentine said: ""We all did.""
Adhara said: ""It must've been a time.  A golden moment."""
"Adhara said: ""Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.""
Valentine said: ""I'm a gracious host."""
"Adhara said: ""I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.""
Valentine said: ""All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool."""
"Valentine said: ""What's the matter?""
Adhara said: ""Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.""
Valentine said: ""The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.""
Adhara said: ""Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.""
Valentine said: ""I sure hope so."""
"Valentine said: ""We think someone is here.""
Adhara said: ""We think?""
Valentine said: ""We can't find ...  ... two of our guys."""
"Valentine said: ""No.""
Adhara said: ""Why not?""

Avery said: ""Come over here."""
"Avery said: ""How they goin', kid?""
Stacy said: ""Not bad.""
Avery said: ""How'd you like to kill someone for me?""
Stacy said: ""Okay."""
"Avery said: ""Same as last time -- the rest after.""
Stacy said: ""Where do we go?""
Avery said: ""When you find the guy, you'll know.""
Stacy said: ""What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.""
Avery said: ""I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.""
Stacy said: ""This is un-fucking professional.""
Avery said: ""See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.""
Stacy said: ""Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.""
Avery said: ""That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God."""
"Valentine said: ""What.""
Avery said: ""There's been some trouble downtown.""
Valentine said: ""What kind?""
Avery said: ""What the papers used to call a ""gangland slaying.""""
Valentine said: ""Our black friends?""
Avery said: ""No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.""
Valentine said: ""I thought he was in prison, in England.""
Avery said: ""Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you."""
"Avery said: ""You should have let me do the talking.""
Valentine said: ""Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.""
Avery said: ""What did you tell them."""
"Valentine said: ""I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.""
Avery said: ""Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.""
Valentine said: ""As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.""
Avery said: ""And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.""
Valentine said: ""I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>."""
"Valentine said: ""Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.""
Avery said: ""We'll find him.""
Valentine said: ""No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.""
Avery said: ""You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.""
Valentine said: ""You think I'm staying?""
Avery said: ""There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.""
Valentine said: ""Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me."""
"Creep said: ""You broke last time.""
Stacy said: ""Let him break - he likes to break.""
Creep said: ""Fuck you.""

"Dealer said: ""Oh really?  Where you from?""
Wilson said: ""England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.""
Dealer said: ""You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?""
Wilson said: ""Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.""
Dealer said: ""You're in gun country now, my friend.""
Wilson said: ""Been to the Boat Show.""
Dealer said: ""Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece."""
"Dealer said: ""I can take care of the paperwork.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah?""
Dealer said: ""No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen."""
"Dealer said: ""Man knows what he likes.""
Ed said: ""Lookin' good.""
Dealer said: ""That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.""
Ed said: ""What'd you call that -- the Protector?""
Dealer said: ""Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market."""

Dealer said: ""Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home."""

Ed said: ""Eduardo.  Rama.""
Wilson said: ""You're home, then."""
"Ed said: ""I didn't expect anyone.""
Wilson said: ""No reason.""
Ed said: ""I mean, what has it been -- six months?""
Wilson said: ""Round about, yeah."""
"Ed said: ""I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.""
Wilson said: ""It was better than a telegram."""
"Wilson said: ""Who done it, then?""
Ed said: ""Huh?""
Wilson said: ""Snuffed her."""
"Ed said: ""I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.""
Wilson said: ""No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that."""
"Wilson said: ""This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.""
Ed said: ""Terry Valentine.""
Wilson said: ""Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?""
Ed said: ""I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine."""
"Wilson said: ""What more is there.""
Ed said: ""I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ..."""
"Ed said: ""Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.""
Wilson said: ""No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.""
Ed said: ""I dunno ... Maybe they do."""
"Ed said: ""Boomerang.""
Wilson said: ""Y'what?""
Ed said: ""I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.""
Wilson said: ""This ain't your lot?""
Ed said: ""You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth."""

Wilson said: ""I only asked."""
"Wilson said: ""What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?""
Ed said: ""That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.""
Wilson said: ""Where abouts?"""
"Ed said: ""Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.""
Wilson said: ""Did Jenny know?""
Ed said: ""Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day."""
"Ed said: ""What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?""
Wilson said: ""Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.""
Ed said: ""Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around."""
"Ed said: ""You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.""
Wilson said: ""She didn't write to me, did she.""
Ed said: ""She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.""
Wilson said: ""Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?""
Ed said: ""Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.""
Wilson said: ""I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.""
Ed said: ""I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.""
Wilson said: ""Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.""
Ed said: ""But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man."""
"Ed said: ""You're kiddin' me, right?""
Wilson said: ""What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?""
Ed said: ""These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.""
Wilson said: ""Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded."""
"Ed said: ""Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?""
Wilson said: ""Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.""
Ed said: ""Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.""
Wilson said: ""Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all."""
"Ed said: ""He don't have a concealed weapons permit.""
Wilson said: ""Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit."""

Ed said: ""Not me, man.""
Wilson said: ""I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?"""
"Ed said: ""You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.""
Wilson said: ""Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed."""
"Ed said: ""Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.""
Wilson said: ""It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?""
Ed said: ""Five years, I think.  Long time.""
Wilson said: ""Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him."""
"Ed said: ""Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a ""private"" service.  Private for who. Him?""
Wilson said: ""Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.""
Ed said: ""He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.""
Wilson said: ""And that's where you met Jenny.""
Ed said: ""No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.""
Wilson said: ""How'd the two of you hook up, then?""
Ed said: ""Oh, Jenny was in my acting class."""
"Ed said: ""Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.""
Wilson said: ""Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.""
Ed said: ""Who'd you butcher at the house?""
Wilson said: ""Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.""
Ed said: ""Huh?""
Wilson said: ""He's brought in the heavy mob.""
Ed said: ""What?""
Wilson said: ""Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.""
Ed said: ""Has he?""
Wilson said: ""They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it."""
"Ed said: ""That was one of them?""
Wilson said: ""See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all."""
"Wilson said: ""What's so fucking funny?""
Ed said: ""Those aren't guards.  They're valets."""
"Wilson said: ""Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?""
Ed said: ""<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party."""
"Wilson said: ""Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.""
Ed said: ""I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.""
Wilson said: ""Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.""
Ed said: ""No one else is even here yet.""
Wilson said: ""First in, first out, that's me."""
"Wilson said: ""What are we standing on?""
Ed said: ""Faith."""
"Wilson said: ""Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?""
Ed said: ""You goin' back inside?""
Wilson said: ""One thing I need."""
"Wilson said: ""Steady on.""
Ed said: ""You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there."""
"Ed said: ""Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.""
Wilson said: ""That would be too easy.""
Ed said: ""Too easy?""
Wilson said: ""He's gotta know why.""
Ed said: ""You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?"""
"Ed said: ""I've been wondering something.""
Wilson said: ""Again?""
Ed said: ""Do you have any friends, man?""
Wilson said: ""Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads."""
"Wilson said: ""Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.""
Ed said: ""What post office?""
Wilson said: ""The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn."""
"Ed said: ""What d'you say, Elaine?""
Elaine said: ""Not much -- you?""
Ed said: ""Same.""
Elaine said: ""Uh-huh.""
Ed said: ""Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?""
Elaine said: ""Probably.""
Ed said: ""I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.""
Elaine said: ""Really.""
Ed said: ""Didn't get it.""
Elaine said: ""Well, those are the breaks.""
Ed said: ""Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.""
Elaine said: ""You just cooking then?""
Ed said: ""Hell, no.  I started writing."""
"Ed said: ""Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?""
Elaine said: ""No, but I know what he means."""
"Ed said: ""... Reminds me of Jennifer.""
Elaine said: ""Hard to miss."""
"Ed said: ""I thought maybe you just came for the ride.""
Elaine said: ""I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A."""
"Wilson said: ""Had a feeling it was you.""
Elaine said: ""You look alike.""
Wilson said: ""Perhaps it was the smoke.""
Elaine said: ""Not her brand.""
Wilson said: ""She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop."""
"Elaine said: ""Why did you come here?""
Wilson said: ""Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?""
Elaine said: ""No, why did you come here?"""
"Wilson said: ""Sort a few things out.""
Elaine said: ""Been busy, have you.""
Wilson said: ""How d'you mean?""
Elaine said: ""It's been a while.""
Wilson said: ""I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.""
Elaine said: ""That's not what I heard.""
Wilson said: ""What was that, then?""
Elaine said: ""I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- ""at Her Majesty's pleasure.""""
Wilson said: ""It was the bars, then."""
"Elaine said: ""In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.""
Wilson said: ""Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.""
Elaine said: ""And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?""
Wilson said: ""Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.""
Elaine said: ""Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you."""
"Wilson said: ""Here, aren't you gonna let me in.""
Elaine said: ""Try calling me again."""
"Wilson said: ""... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.""
Elaine said: ""Sounds like Beverly Hills.""
Wilson said: ""Here, are you always this sarky?""
Elaine said: ""Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.""
Wilson said: ""Weren't you on a television series?""
Elaine said: ""If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?""
Wilson said: ""Said it went on for donkey's years.""
Elaine said: ""Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.""
Wilson said: ""Oh, it just ended, then.""
Elaine said: ""Now who's being sarcastic?""
Wilson said: ""When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.""
Elaine said: ""I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars."""
"Wilson said: ""I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.""
Elaine said: ""Not embarrassed.""
Wilson said: ""Ashamed.""
Elaine said: ""Not ashamed."""
"Elaine said: ""Disappointed.""
Wilson said: ""She never told Eddie, though.""
Elaine said: ""She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.""
Wilson said: ""How'd you manage that, then.""
Elaine said: ""When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah, well, she started all that in London.""
Elaine said: ""Modelling.""
Wilson said: ""Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know."""
"Elaine said: ""You weren't disappointed in her, then.""
Wilson said: ""In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.""
Elaine said: ""She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.""
Wilson said: ""Footloose and fancy free.""
Elaine said: ""She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't."""
"Elaine said: ""When did you get in?""
Wilson said: ""Yesterday.  Afternoon.""
Elaine said: ""You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.""
Wilson said: ""No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...""
Elaine said: ""I might've been away for the weekend.""
Wilson said: ""Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.""
Elaine said: ""And you've seen Eddie Rama.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers."""
"Elaine said: ""I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.""
Wilson said: ""He give me your address.""
Elaine said: ""I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.""
Wilson said: ""Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.""
Elaine said: ""Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?""
Wilson said: ""Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir."""
"Elaine said: ""The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?""
Wilson said: ""Nah, accommodation address.""
Elaine said: ""What's that, like a P.O. box.""
Wilson said: ""Something like that, yeah.""
Elaine said: ""Where you get your bank statements."""
"Wilson said: ""I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.""
Elaine said: ""That's what was estimated.""
Wilson said: ""Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen."""
"Elaine said: ""Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?""
Wilson said: ""Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it."""
"Elaine said: ""Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.""
Wilson said: ""Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --""
Elaine said: ""-- Your employer?""
Wilson said: ""-- Mr. Lindgren.""
Elaine said: ""Who's Mr. Lindgren?""
Wilson said: ""My employer.""
Elaine said: ""What line is he in.""
Wilson said: ""Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.""
Elaine said: ""I see.""
Wilson said: ""Based in London, but with international concerns.""
Elaine said: ""I bet.""
Wilson said: ""Various enterprises, style of thing.""
Elaine said: ""I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.""
Wilson said: ""Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.""
Elaine said: ""Right.""
Wilson said: ""Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.""
Elaine said: ""In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?""
Wilson said: ""This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.""
Elaine said: ""-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him."""
"Elaine said: ""So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.""
Wilson said: ""Why not.""
Elaine said: ""Are you serious.""
Wilson said: ""Have you ever known me not to be."""
"Elaine said: ""You fuckin' guys and your dicks.""
Wilson said: ""What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].""
Elaine said: ""You don't believe it was a car accident.""
Wilson said: ""What do you think.""
Elaine said: ""Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.""
Wilson said: ""Depends, don' it.""
Elaine said: ""On what.  What makes you so certain.""
Wilson said: ""I'll bloody well ask him.""
Elaine said: ""There's the phone.  You want his number."""
"Elaine said: ""Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.""
Wilson said: ""She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.""
Elaine said: ""She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive."""
"Wilson said: ""How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.""
Elaine said: ""You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.""
Wilson said: ""And how did you get it?"""
"Elaine said: ""This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as ""the early 70's.""  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.""
Wilson said: ""Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.""
Elaine said: ""These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?"""
"Wilson said: ""You don't seem bothered.""
Elaine said: ""You don't know how I've compromised my standards.""
Wilson said: ""Tell us about it.""
Elaine said: ""It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.""
Wilson said: ""Oh, I was gonna say ...""
Elaine said: ""Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.""
Wilson said: ""I can see the attraction."""
"Elaine said: ""What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.""
Wilson said: ""A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.""
Elaine said: ""You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.""
Wilson said: ""We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.""
Elaine said: ""It didn't discourage you, though.""
Wilson said: ""Hey?""
Elaine said: ""From pursuing your chosen profession.""
Wilson said: ""I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.""
Elaine said: ""I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.""
Wilson said: ""Did you.  What was that in aid of?""
Elaine said: ""Who remembers.""
Wilson said: ""Get seven years, did you?""
Elaine said: ""Overnight.  What about just now?""
Wilson said: ""Just now?  Overnight?""
Elaine said: ""You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?""
Wilson said: ""It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.""
Elaine said: ""I don't believe it.""
Wilson said: ""Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.""
Elaine said: ""Pushing the legal limit even then."""
"Elaine said: ""-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.""
Wilson said: ""You ever been to London?""
Elaine said: ""Only in the movies.""
Wilson said: ""I've 'ardly ever left it.""
Elaine said: ""Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.""
Wilson said: ""I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.""
Elaine said: ""Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes."""
"Wilson said: ""Not that I recall.""
Elaine said: ""What about your grandmother?""
Wilson said: ""Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.""
Elaine said: ""He alive to see this?""
Wilson said: ""Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.""
Elaine said: ""What'd your father do?""
Wilson said: ""Black market during the war."""
"Elaine said: ""I guess you're just habitual.""
Wilson said: ""You sound like my fucking probation officer.""
Elaine said: ""Won't he be looking for you about now?""
Wilson said: ""Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.""
Elaine said: ""Minor officials bother you, don't they?""
Wilson said: ""Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?"""
"Wilson said: ""I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.""
Elaine said: ""A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.""
Wilson said: ""I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids."""
"Wilson said: ""Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.""
Elaine said: ""She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.""
Wilson said: ""Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.""
Elaine said: ""Still, you could never ... do what she wanted."""
"Wilson said: ""She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  ""If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya.""  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  ""I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now"" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.""
Elaine said: ""She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.""
Wilson said: ""I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out."""
"Wilson said: ""Where's Big Sur?""
Elaine said: ""Up the coast.""
Wilson said: ""How far?""
Elaine said: ""I don't know -- few hours, I guess.""
Wilson said: ""Fancy it?""
Elaine said: ""I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.""
Wilson said: ""Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.""
Elaine said: ""What's in Big Sur?""
Wilson said: ""That's where Valentine's scarpered.""
Elaine said: ""How do you know?""
Wilson said: ""Bloke told me."""
"Elaine said: ""Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.""
Wilson said: ""You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...""
Elaine said: ""Poor baby."""
"Elaine said: ""You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.""
Wilson said: ""Too bleeding true, 'n' it."""
"Feather said: ""There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.""
Wilson said: ""Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.""
Feather said: ""Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.""
Wilson said: ""I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.""
Feather said: ""But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.""
Wilson said: ""Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.""
Feather said: ""Yeah, I guess you are.""
Wilson said: ""Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.""
Feather said: ""That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.""
Feather said: ""So what's your beef, pal?""
Wilson said: ""Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.""
Feather said: ""It was you.  Downtown.""
Wilson said: ""Eh?""
Feather said: ""Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.""
Wilson said: ""No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.""
Feather said: ""He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.""
Wilson said: ""All of what?""
Feather said: ""Of the deal, man.""
Wilson said: ""Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.""
Feather said: ""But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.""
Wilson said: ""As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.""
Feather said: ""In which case I'll just do what I usually do.""
Wilson said: ""And that is?""
Feather said: ""What am I doing?"""
"Gramms said: ""Valentine had himself a party, I hear.""
Fielding said: ""My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.""
Gramms said: ""A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.""
Fielding said: ""Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.""
Gramms said: ""Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?""
Fielding said: ""My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.""
Gramms said: ""So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.""
Fielding said: ""He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.""
Gramms said: ""Where is he now?""
Fielding said: ""He had urgent business in the north."""
"Guy said: ""Don't you work with Ian?""
Wilson said: ""Ian?""
Guy said: ""I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.""
Wilson said: ""Sorry.  Wasn't me.""
Guy said: ""You sure?""
Wilson said: ""Unless I'm not who I think I am.""
Guy said: ""That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah?""
Guy said: ""Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.""
Wilson said: ""No kidding.""
Guy said: ""What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?""
Wilson said: ""Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.""
Guy said: ""Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah.  Cheers, mate."""
"Wilson said: ""Yeah, that's right.""
Lady said: ""I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back."""
"Wilson said: ""I would have preferred staying home, me.""
Lady said: ""You're a reluctant traveller, then."""
"Lady said: ""You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.""
Lady said: ""No rest for the wicked."""
"Wilson said: ""Been away a lot.""
Lady said: ""Where else?"""
"Wilson said: ""Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.""
Lady said: ""Nine years?  Is that legal?""
Wilson said: ""Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.""
Lady said: ""But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.""
Wilson said: ""I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.""
Lady said: ""Sounds like you need a rest.""
Wilson said: ""Could do, yeah."""
"Wilson said: ""But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.""
Lady said: ""The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.""
Wilson said: ""Yeah."""
"Uncle John said: ""How much.""
Stacy said: ""Five thousand.""
Uncle John said: ""Hey.""
Stacy said: ""I got half.""
Uncle John said: ""Makin' trouble for someone?""

Stacy said: ""The forever kind."""
"Stacy said: ""Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.""

Stacy said: ""Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.""
Stacy said: ""... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.""
Stacy said: ""Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.""
Stacy said: ""Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.""
Stacy said: ""Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?""
Stacy said: ""Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?""
Uncle John said: ""I don't know.""

Uncle John said: ""What d'you mean, any happier?""
Stacy said: ""Any happier than any other asshole in life."""

Uncle John said: ""Lemme break."""
"Uncle John said: ""We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.""
Stacy said: ""There's more than a measly few grand in this.""
Uncle John said: ""There is?""
Stacy said: ""Something's on.""
Uncle John said: ""What?""
Stacy said: ""I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.""
Uncle John said: ""You do?""
Stacy said: ""You bet.""
Uncle John said: ""Like what.""
Stacy said: ""Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs ""plausible denial.""""
Uncle John said: ""Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.""
Stacy said: """"He ain't wrong.""  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.""
Uncle John said: ""I don't get it.""
Stacy said: ""I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.""
Uncle John said: ""What's in it?""
Stacy said: ""Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.""
Uncle John said: ""How we gonna get that lucky?""
Stacy said: ""While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in."""
"Supervisor said: ""How'd you get in here.""
Wilson said: ""Walked.""
Supervisor said: ""You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.""
Wilson said: ""Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?"""

Wilson said: ""I doubt it."""

Wilson said: ""I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.""
Supervisor said: ""Jennifer Wilson."""
"Wilson said: ""You know her?""
Supervisor said: ""Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now."""
"Wilson said: ""Is Valentine here?""
Supervisor said: ""What do you think?"""
"Wilson said: ""Where is he, then?""
Supervisor said: ""Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?"""
"Valentine said: ""Hello there.""
Susan said: ""What are you doing here?""
Valentine said: ""Exercising my visitation rights.""
Susan said: ""Since when?""
Valentine said: ""I miss my kids.""
Susan said: ""They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore."""
"Valentine said: ""You've made it ... brighter.""
Susan said: ""I don't want you here, Terry.""
Valentine said: ""Sure you do."""
"Susan said: ""What kind of trouble are you in?""
Valentine said: ""No trouble."""
"Susan said: ""Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.""
Valentine said: ""Susan."""
"Valentine said: ""Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --""
Susan said: ""-- You know his name is Frank.""
Valentine said: ""Is he here?""
Susan said: ""You know I don't live with him.""
Valentine said: ""Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --""
Susan said: ""Are you finished?""
Valentine said: ""In a couple of days this whole thing --""
Susan said: ""Who's looking for you?""
Valentine said: ""Go now."""
"Susan said: ""It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.""
Valentine said: ""That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple."""
"Wilson said: ""Pleasure.""
Valentine said: ""Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --""
Wilson said: ""EMI in London.  I work with Ian.""
Valentine said: ""Ah.""
Wilson said: ""You must know Ian.""
Valentine said: ""I don't.""
Wilson said: ""Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.""
Valentine said: ""I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.""
Wilson said: ""Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention."""
"Valentine said: ""Thanks.  You, too.""
Wilson said: ""Be seein' you."""
"Valentine said: ""What.""
Wilson said: ""Tell me.""
Valentine said: ""Tell you ...""
Wilson said: ""About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard."""

"Ann said: ""Hello, Ed.""
Ed said: ""Ann. Will you come in?"""
"Ed said: ""...I'm so sorry about your loss.""
Ann said: ""Yes. Thank you.""
Ed said: ""Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all."""
"Ann said: ""Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...""
Ed said: ""Yes, Ann?""
Ann said: ""And you should tell Doris..."""
"Ed said: ""Yes?""
Ann said: ""We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed."""
"Ed said: ""...Yes?""
Ann said: ""At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.""
Ed said: ""Ann--""
Ann said: ""A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.""
Ed said: ""Ann--""
Ann said: ""The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--""
Ed said: ""Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?""
Ann said: ""Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again."""
"Ed said: ""...You don't like the music out there?""
Birdy said: ""It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily."""
"Ed said: ""Hello, Rachel.""
Birdy said: ""I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.""
Ed said: ""Yeah. Thanks."""
"Birdy said: ""He was deaf when he wrote this.""
Ed said: ""Who?""
Birdy said: ""Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow."""
"Birdy said: ""Hi, Mr Crane.""
Ed said: ""Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.""
Birdy said: ""Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.""
Ed said: ""Hello, Tony."""
"Birdy said: ""Hello, Mr Crane.""
Ed said: ""Hello, Birdy.""
Birdy said: ""We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry."""
"Ed said: ""Yeah.""
Birdy said: ""We've certainly missed you.""
Ed said: ""Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards..."""
"Ed said: ""...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--""
Birdy said: ""Pop doesn't like people smoking in here."""
"Ed said: ""Sure... Sure, it's his house.""
Birdy said: ""That's what he keeps telling me."""
"Ed said: ""Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.""
Birdy said: ""Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.""
Ed said: ""That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.""
Birdy said: ""Boy.""
Ed said: ""You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--""
Birdy said: ""Oh, Mr Crane--""
Ed said: ""I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.""
Birdy said: ""Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.""
Ed said: ""I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.""
Birdy said: ""Geez, Mr Crane.""
Ed said: ""Just see him, as a favor to me."""
"Birdy said: ""...I stank, didn't I?""
Ed said: ""He didn't say that.""
Birdy said: ""But more or less.""
Ed said: ""Look, I'm no expert, but--""
Birdy said: ""It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.""
Ed said: ""I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.""
Birdy said: ""But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally."""
"Birdy said: ""...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.""
Ed said: ""...Uh-huh.""
Birdy said: ""I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.""
Ed said: ""Ah... it's nothing.""
Birdy said: ""I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?""
Ed said: ""Huh.""
Birdy said: ""You're an enthusiast.""
Ed said: ""Huh. Yeah. Maybe..."""
"Ed said: ""...I guess I've been all wet.""
Birdy said: ""But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane..."""
"Birdy said: ""...I wanted to make you happy.""
Ed said: ""Birdy--""
Birdy said: ""It's OK..."""

Carcanogues said: ""Ah."""
"Carcanogues said: ""...Mm.""
Ed said: ""Well? How'd she do?"""
"Carcanogues said: ""Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.""
Ed said: ""I don't understand.""
Carcanogues said: ""Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.""
Ed said: ""Did she make mistakes?"""
"Carcanogues said: ""Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.""
Ed said: ""I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--""
Carcanogues said: ""Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur..."""
"Carcanogues said: ""...she can go up there.""
Ed said: ""Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--""
Carcanogues said: ""Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist."""
"Creighton said: ""A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?""
Ed said: ""Uh--""
Creighton said: ""Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!""
Ed said: ""That right.""
Creighton said: ""It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.""
Ed said: ""Huh.""
Creighton said: ""That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on..."""
"Ed said: ""...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?""
Creighton said: ""Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.""
Ed said: ""I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.""
Creighton said: ""Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber."""

Ed said: ""I can get it, yeah.""
Creighton said: ""Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?""
Ed said: ""No. I--tell me--""
Creighton said: ""Sure.""
Ed said: ""What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?""
Creighton said: ""Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.""
Ed said: ""And how do we share--""
Creighton said: ""Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?""
Ed said: ""I'll have it in a week.""
Creighton said: ""Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well..."""
"Creighton said: ""...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...""

Ed said: ""Cash.""
Creighton said: ""Cash?!"""
"Creighton said: ""...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?""
Ed said: ""Sure.""
Creighton said: ""I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?""
Ed said: ""Yeah.""
Creighton said: ""Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--""
Ed said: ""It's OK.""
Creighton said: ""Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?"""
"Creighton said: ""...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--""

Ed said: ""Mm.""
Dave said: ""She's a rare one.""
Ed said: ""How's business, Dave?""
Dave said: ""Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?""
Ed said: ""All right, I guess.""
Dave said: ""...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day."""

Ed said: ""What is it, Dave?"""
"Ed said: ""Uh-huh.""
Dave said: ""Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.""

Dave said: ""Well, you know what that would do to me.""
Ed said: ""I guess it would be pretty awkward.""
Dave said: ""Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.""
Ed said: ""Uh-huh.""
Dave said: ""I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.""
Ed said: ""How much to they want, Dave?""
Dave said: ""$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.""
Ed said: ""...You know... who *who* is?""
Dave said: ""The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.""
Ed said: ""Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.""
Dave said: ""Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.""

"Dave said: ""...Oh, Jesus.""
Ed said: ""...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?""
Dave said: ""That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.""

Diedrickson said: ""I, uh... thanks."""
"Diedrickson said: ""...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.""
Ed said: ""My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years."""

Doris said: ""Honey?""
Ed said: ""Mm."""

Doris said: ""Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.""

Ed said: ""You don't have to--""
Doris said: ""I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.""
Ed said: ""You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer."""
"Doris said: ""I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.""
Ed said: ""Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider."""
"Doris said: ""Should I... should I tell you why?""
Ed said: ""You don't have to tell me anything."""

Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?""
Ed said: ""No. Of course not. She didn't do it.""
Riedenschneider said: ""Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?""

They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--""

Riedenschneider said: ""Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?"""
"Ed said: ""...I don't get it.""
Riedenschneider said: ""Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.""
Ed said: ""Yeah.""
Riedenschneider said: ""And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money..."""
"Riedenschneider said: ""...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!""
Ed said: ""So... who... who actually--""
Riedenschneider said: ""Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try."""
"Riedenschneider said: ""Not guilty, your honor...""
Ed said: ""I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave..."""
"Ed said: ""...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...""
Riedenschneider said: ""...a puny player on the great world's stage...""
Ed said: ""...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...""
Riedenschneider said: ""...who among us is in a position to say...""
Ed said: ""...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake..."""
"Riedenschneider said: ""...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...""
Ed said: ""...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway..."""

Walter said: ""Oh, hell. Drink?""
Ed said: ""No thanks.""
Walter said: ""Sure you don't need one?""
Ed said: ""I'm fine.""
Walter said: ""OK. Boy. Jesus!""
Ed said: ""Yeah. What do I, uh...""
Walter said: ""Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless."""
"Walter said: ""'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.""
Ed said: ""He a good man?""
Walter said: ""Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...""

Walter said: ""Taking it seriously.""
Ed said: ""So, who should I--"""
"Walter said: ""Coffee, Ed?""
Ed said: ""I'm fine. Thanks.""
Walter said: ""No thanks, honey."""
"Ed said: ""...So, uh, who should I--""
Walter said: ""Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here."""
"Walter said: ""...Probity.""
Ed said: ""Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...""
Walter said: ""Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.""
Ed said: ""Uh-huh. He's the, uh...""
Walter said: ""Yeah, the best."""
"Walter said: ""Ed, how're you holding up?""
Ed said: ""I'm OK, Walter, thanks."""
"Walter said: ""I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.""
Ed said: ""Yeah.""

Ed said: ""Yeah.""
Young Man said: ""Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.""

Young Woman said: ""Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven."""

Ed said: ""Uh-huh.""
Frank said: ""The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.""
Ed said: ""Uh-huh.""
Frank said: ""Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?""
Ed said: ""Yeah.""
Frank said: ""Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed..."""

Frank said: ""Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?""
Ed said: ""No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.""
Frank said: ""Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid."""

D'Agosta said: ""Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --""
Cuthbert said: ""He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now."""

Pendergast said: ""I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.""
Cuthbert said: ""We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that."""
"Pendergast said: ""If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.""
Cuthbert said: ""Do they have to wear uniforms?""
Pendergast said: ""Yes.""
Cuthbert said: ""I don't want to scare people.""

"Ippolito said: ""This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.""
D'Agosta said: ""The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.""
Ippolito said: ""It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.""
D'Agosta said: ""That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?""
Ippolito said: ""In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.""
D'Agosta said: ""That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?""
Ippolito said: ""You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail."""
"Ippolito said: ""The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!""
D'Agosta said: ""What doors?""
Ippolito said: ""I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --""
D'Agosta said: ""You said the system couldn't fail!"""

Ippolito said: ""Like hell!"""
"Ippolito said: ""D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.""

Pendergast said: ""In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.""
D'Agosta said: ""I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?""
Pendergast said: ""Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.""
D'Agosta said: ""Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit."""
"Pendergast said: ""Lieutenant --""
D'Agosta said: ""Call me Vince.""
Pendergast said: ""Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.""
D'Agosta said: ""Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?""
Pendergast said: ""Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.""
D'Agosta said: ""So the method of death is the only connection?""
Pendergast said: ""No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat."""

Pendergast said: ""I believed them."""

Pendergast said: ""No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.""
D'Agosta said: ""Oh."""
"D'Agosta said: ""What happened to them?""
Pendergast said: ""If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test."""
"D'Agosta said: ""Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?""
Pendergast said: ""Correct."""
"D'Agosta said: ""I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --""
Pendergast said: ""This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.""

D'Agosta said: ""The sub-basement?""
Pendergast said: ""I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out."""
"D'Agosta said: ""I smell it.  It's here.""
Pendergast said: ""Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!""
D'Agosta said: ""Everybody.  Get behind me."""
"Pendergast said: ""Nice to see you, Lieutenant.""
D'Agosta said: ""The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea."""

Dr. Ziewzic said: ""Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check."""

Pendergast said: ""The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?""
Dr. Ziewzic said: ""Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision."""
"Frock said: ""Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --""
Margo said: ""I don't believe it.""
Frock said: ""Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.""
Margo said: ""We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.""
Frock said: ""That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm."""
"Frock said: ""Please.  Don't humiliate me further.""
Margo said: ""Let me help.  I can take care of everything.""
Frock said: ""No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.""
Margo said: ""How can you say that?  You know it's not true.""
Frock said: ""Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --""
Margo said: ""My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.""
Frock said: ""With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.""
Margo said: ""Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.""
Frock said: ""Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art."""
"Frock said: ""Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.""
Margo said: ""I'm not giving up.""
Frock said: ""You must."""
"Frock said: ""This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.""
Margo said: ""You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.""
Frock said: ""Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough."""
"Margo said: ""That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.""
Frock said: ""Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems."""
"Frock said: ""I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.""
Margo said: ""A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.""
Frock said: ""Let me see the plant press."""
"Margo said: ""What is it?""
Frock said: ""I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.""
Margo said: ""Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.""
Frock said: ""You're right."""
"Frock said: ""Margo, these aren't seed pods.""
Margo said: ""What are they?""
Frock said: ""They're eggs."""
"Frock said: ""Like the claw.""
Margo said: ""Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.""
Frock said: ""Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.""
Margo said: ""Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?"""
"Margo said: ""Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.""
Frock said: ""That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.""
Margo said: ""But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  ""Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."""""
"Margo said: ""All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  ""Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters."" That means it's highly intelligent. ""Quadrupedal.""""
Frock said: ""Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  ""He Who Walks on All Fours."""""
"Margo said: """"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm""... poor eyesight.  ""External mucoid nasal glands,""... very keen scent... ""Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme.""""
Frock said: ""So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.""
Margo said: ""With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.""
Frock said: ""Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.""
Margo said: ""And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...""
Frock said: ""It's like ringing the dinner bell."""
"Margo said: ""What's going on?""
Frock said: ""Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?""
Margo said: ""I think so."""
"Margo said: ""Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?""
Frock said: ""Don't stop now."""
"Margo said: ""What's that?""
Frock said: ""It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!"""
"Margo said: ""None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.""
Frock said: ""We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.""
Margo said: ""That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes."""
"Frock said: ""I'm coming with you.""
Margo said: ""No, Dr. Frock.  You can't."""
"Frock said: ""Come back and get me.""
Margo said: ""We will.""
Frock said: ""Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!"""
"Margo said: ""Dr. Frock?""
Frock said: ""Look who's here, Margo."""
"Pendergast said: ""Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.""
Frock said: ""Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.""
Pendergast said: ""How many storage areas are there?""
Frock said: ""They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display."""
"Pendergast said: ""Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?""
Frock said: ""Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans."""
"Frock said: ""Something tried to get into this room!""
Pendergast said: ""And failed.  These doors are solid steel.""
Frock said: ""This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!""
Pendergast said: ""I wouldn't be so sure."""
"Frock said: ""It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.""
Pendergast said: ""Read it out loud.""
Frock said: """"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."""""
"Pendergast said: ""You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.""
Frock said: ""Yes.""
Pendergast said: ""Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?""
Frock said: ""Not really.  Just the sub-basement."""
"Pendergast said: ""Where is that?""
Frock said: ""I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.""
Pendergast said: ""You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?"""
"Frock said: ""We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.""
Pendergast said: ""I don't believe it."""
"Frock said: ""Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.""
Pendergast said: ""He's right."""
"Frock said: ""What's that?""
Pendergast said: ""Footsteps!"""
"Pendergast said: ""Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?""
Frock said: ""They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta."""
"Henry said: ""You work here?""
Margo said: ""Yes, I do.""
Henry said: ""What do you do?""
Margo said: ""I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?""
Henry said: ""Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?""
Margo said: ""Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.""
Henry said: ""Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.""
Margo said: ""Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class."""
"Larry said: ""This room sucks.""
Henry said: ""She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.""
Larry said: ""Let's ditch and find them ourselves."""
"Larry said: ""We're not supposed to go back there.""
Henry said: ""Chicken.  This is a great short cut."""
"Larry said: ""I don't want to go this way.""
Henry said: ""Don't be a wuss.  Come on."""
"Henry said: ""Quiet!""
Larry said: ""What is it?""
Henry said: ""I don't know.  But I think it's bad."""
"Henry said: ""We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.""
Larry said: ""Big as a house.""
Henry said: ""Not that big.""
Larry said: ""Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise."""
"Larry said: ""And it snuffled the ground like a dog.""
Henry said: ""Like this."""
"Larry said: ""It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.""
Henry said: ""They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.""
Larry said: ""They were yellow!""
Henry said: ""You're color blind."""
"Pendergast said: ""Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.""
Jonathan said: ""The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.""
Pendergast said: ""Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left."""
"Jonathan said: ""They've got something.""
Pendergast said: ""Keep the light up.  I can't see."""
"Pendergast said: ""Shut them up!""
Jonathan said: ""Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!"""
"Pendergast said: ""Stop!""
Jonathan said: ""Holy mother, what is that?"""
"Jonathan said: ""Argo!  Hobbes!""
Pendergast said: ""Get back!  Now!"""
"Jonathan said: ""There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?""
Pendergast said: ""He's right.  Follow me."""
"Jonathan said: ""Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.""
Pendergast said: ""Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.""
Jonathan said: ""It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?""
Pendergast said: ""Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer."""
"Jonathan said: ""Oh... my... God!""
Pendergast said: ""Quiet."""
"Jonathan said: ""Jesus, what is this?""
Pendergast said: ""Another storage room."""
"Jonathan said: ""Oh no.  I smell it.""
Pendergast said: ""Keep the animal quiet."""
"Kawakita said: ""If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.""
Margo said: ""But at what a price."""
"Margo said: ""I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.""
Kawakita said: ""Margo, you haven't heard?""
Margo said: ""What?""
Kawakita said: ""Frock's been fired."""
"Margo said: ""That's impossible.""
Kawakita said: ""I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week."""
"Margo said: ""For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?""
Kawakita said: ""Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal."""
"Margo said: ""Mbwun.""
Kawakita said: ""What's that?"""
"Kawakita said: ""What do you make of it, Margo?""
Margo said: ""It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian."""
"Margo said: ""Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.""
Kawakita said: ""Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.""
Margo said: ""There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage."""
"Kawakita said: ""What kind of egg is it?""
Margo said: ""It's reptilian."""
"Kawakita said: ""These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!""
Margo said: ""What kind of hormones?"""
"Kawakita said: ""4-monoxytocin is... ""A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland.""""
Margo said: ""Try Weinstein's tropic hormone."""
"Margo said: ""This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!""
Kawakita said: ""So what?""
Margo said: ""Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!""
Kawakita said: ""Eats them?""
Margo said: ""Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing."""
"Kawakita said: ""Is Dr. Frock safe!""
Margo said: ""Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!"""
"Kawakita said: ""Got to finish this thesis sometime.""
Margo said: ""How about lunch?""
Kawakita said: ""Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.""
Margo said: ""Okay."""
"Pendergast said: ""Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?""
Margo said: ""An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.""
Pendergast said: ""How does it work?""
Margo said: ""With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.""
Pendergast said: ""No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley."""
"Margo said: ""Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?""
Pendergast said: ""Maybe not.""
Margo said: ""If he were alive he'd have contacted me.""
Pendergast said: ""You have time to talk?"""
"Pendergast said: ""Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.""
Margo said: ""And John?""
Pendergast said: ""Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.""
Margo said: ""I don't understand.""
Pendergast said: ""The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact."""
"Margo said: ""John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --""
Pendergast said: ""You loved him.""
Margo said: ""Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.""
Pendergast said: ""You were going to be married.""
Margo said: ""How did you know that?""
Pendergast said: ""I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.""
Margo said: ""That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.""
Pendergast said: ""You were afraid of him, weren't you?""
Margo said: ""He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.""
Pendergast said: ""Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?""
Margo said: ""A legendary monster called Mbwun.""
Pendergast said: ""A monster?""
Margo said: ""Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a ""monster species"".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.""
Pendergast said: ""What happened?""
Margo said: ""No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals."""
"Margo said: ""No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.""
Pendergast said: ""What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?""
Margo said: ""I don't understand.""
Pendergast said: ""Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.""
Margo said: ""My God.  Then it was an animal.""
Pendergast said: ""I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?""
Margo said: ""I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.""
Pendergast said: ""Would you mind showing it to me?"""
"Pendergast said: ""Where would we find it?""
Margo said: ""I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.""
Pendergast said: ""All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps."""
"Pendergast said: ""What happened?""
Margo said: ""I don't know.""
Pendergast said: ""I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.""
Margo said: ""You were behind me?  Running after me?"""
"Margo said: ""It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.""
Pendergast said: ""Where did you see it?""
Margo said: ""Behind me.  Over there."""
"Margo said: ""That's not what I saw.""
Pendergast said: ""All right.  If you're positive."""
"Pendergast said: ""Dr. Green...""
Margo said: ""I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?""
Pendergast said: ""They're all heavily armed.""
Margo said: ""All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.""
Pendergast said: ""What was it?""
Margo said: ""I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw."""
"Pendergast said: ""Genetic damage?""
Margo said: ""When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.""
Pendergast said: ""We need someone to take us to the secure storage area."""
"Margo said: ""Pendergast?  Are you all right?""
Pendergast said: ""No.  I think I'm hallucinating."""
"Margo said: ""You're not.  Where is it?""
Pendergast said: ""Gone.""
Margo said: ""Wounded?""
Pendergast said: ""No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.""
Margo said: ""That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside."""
"Pendergast said: ""I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.""
Margo said: ""It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.""
Pendergast said: ""But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!"""
"Pendergast said: ""But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --""
Margo said: ""We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants."""
"Pendergast said: ""You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.""
Margo said: ""Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here."""
"Pendergast said: ""That was D'Agosta.""
Margo said: ""The planetarium!""
Pendergast said: ""Vince!"""
"Margo said: ""Is there another way around?""
Pendergast said: ""No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors..."""
"Pendergast said: ""Hide quickly!""
Margo said: ""What are you going to do?"""
"Margo said: ""What is it doing?""
Pendergast said: ""It's scared of me."""
"Pendergast said: ""What happened?""
Margo said: ""Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.""
Pendergast said: ""It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?""
Margo said: ""I think... it means it's full.""
Pendergast said: ""Then it won't go after the others?""
Margo said: ""No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.""
Pendergast said: ""For what?""
Margo said: ""I think... for the pleasure of the kill."""
"Margo said: ""We have to try and draw it off!""
Pendergast said: ""How?""
Margo said: ""The answer's right in front of us."""
"Margo said: ""That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!""
Pendergast said: ""It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse."""
"Margo said: ""Help someone!""
Pendergast said: ""Oh God!  Help!"""
"Margo said: ""You smell that?""
Pendergast said: ""It's coming.  Run."""
"Pendergast said: ""We're not going to make the storage room!""
Margo said: ""Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!"""
"Margo said: ""No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!""
Pendergast said: ""What?""
Margo said: ""That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!"""
"Pendergast said: ""I don't believe it.""
Margo said: ""You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!""
Pendergast said: ""Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!"""
"Margo said: ""Just like John.  He won't listen.""
Pendergast said: ""I have to shoot.""
Margo said: ""Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye."""
"Pendergast said: ""He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.""
Margo said: ""I can't!""
Pendergast said: ""You have to.  Do it now!"""
"Margo said: ""I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?""
Pendergast said: ""I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display."""

Simeon said: ""He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep."""
"Christof said: ""Give me a shot from Truman's ring.""
Simeon said: ""He gave it back to his father."""
"Simeon said: ""We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.""
Christof said: ""All prop cars accounted for?""
Simeon said: ""He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear."""
"Simeon said: ""I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.""
Christof said: ""What have we missed?""
Simeon said: ""It's just a matter of time."""
"Christof said: ""We're not watching the sea.""
Simeon said: ""Why would we--""
Christof said: ""Sweep the harbor."""
"Christof said: ""Cue music...""
Simeon said: ""What music?""
Christof said: ""<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner..."""
"Simeon said: ""He doesn't care.""
Christof said: ""Do it!"""
"Interviewer said: ""Welcome.""
Christof said: ""Thank you.""
Interviewer said: ""The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.""
Christof said: ""We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past."""
"Interviewer said: ""Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--""
Christof said: ""--a dead one at that.""
Interviewer said: ""--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.""
Christof said: ""Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.""
Interviewer said: ""I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?""
Christof said: ""That and a fat, new contract.""
Interviewer said: ""How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?""
Christof said: ""Amnesia.""
Interviewer said: ""Of course."""
"Interviewer said: ""Let's talk ratings.  ""Truman"" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?""
Christof said: ""As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.""
Interviewer said: ""But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?""
Christof said: ""It has to be the reality."""
"Christof said: ""We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.""
Interviewer said: ""A window onto the human condition?""
Christof said: ""I prefer to think of it as a mirror."""
"Christof said: ""Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.""
Interviewer said: ""But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?""
Christof said: ""We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?""
Interviewer said: ""Let's go to some of those viewers' calls."""
"Interviewer said: ""Are we talking Emmies?""
Christof said: ""Certainly a nomination.""
Interviewer said: ""Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.""
Christof said: ""As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.""
Interviewer said: ""Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof."""
"Interviewer said: ""We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.""
Christof said: ""Let me demonstrate some examples."""
"Christof said: ""He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.""
Interviewer said: ""Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.""
Christof said: ""In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.""
Interviewer said: ""Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - ""Bringing Up Baby"" - would turn into a ""cradle to grave"" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.""
Christof said: ""That's correct.""
Interviewer said: ""And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.""
Christof said: ""People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.""
Interviewer said: ""No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.""
Christof said: ""Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--""
Interviewer said: ""All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.""
Christof said: ""There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.""
Interviewer said: ""And it's all available in the ""Truman"" Show"" catalogue.  Operators are standing by."""
"Interviewer said: ""Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?""
Christof said: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk."""
"Interviewer said: ""You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?""
Christof said: ""I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.""
Interviewer said: ""The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on ""Tru Talk."""""
"Christof said: ""We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.""
Interviewer said: ""Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on ""Tru Talk."""""
"Truman said: ""Who are you?""
Christof said: ""I'm the creator."""
"Truman said: ""The creator of what?""
Christof said: ""A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.""
Truman said: ""<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?""
Christof said: ""You're the star."""
"Truman said: ""Nothing was real.""
Christof said: ""<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch."""
"Truman said: ""I have a map.""
Christof said: ""Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--""
Truman said: ""--You never had a camera in my head."""
"Daughter said: ""What's he doing?""
Mother said: ""They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.""
Daughter said: ""The memory of who?""
Mother said: ""Shhh!"""
"Daughter said: ""But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?""
Mother said: ""Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.""
Daughter said: ""I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound."""
"Guard 1 said: ""How can they have a child?""
Guard 2 said: ""It's not gonna be his, you idiot.""
Guard 1 said: ""Why not?""

Guard 1 said: ""Sure she would.""
Guard 2 said: ""Guess I always thought they'd adopt."""
"Truman said: ""You take Japanese.""
Lauren said: ""Oh, yes.""
Truman said: ""Lauren, right?""
Lauren said: ""That's right.  Lauren.""
Truman said: ""I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--""
Lauren said: ""--I'm not allowed to talk to you."""
"Truman said: ""It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.""
Lauren said: ""I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.""
Truman said: ""You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do."""
"Lauren said: ""No...I, er.""
Truman said: ""No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?""
Lauren said: ""No.""
Truman said: ""Saturday?"""
"Truman said: ""Actually, I'm free Sunday.""
Lauren said: ""Now.""
Truman said: ""Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.""
Lauren said: ""If we don't go now, it won't happen."""
"Lauren said: ""Well, what do you want to do?""
Truman said: ""I think I've studied enough."""
"Lauren said: ""It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?""
Truman said: ""I...I can't."""
"Truman said: ""I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.""
Marlon said: ""Yeah?  Outta what?""
Truman said: ""Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>"""
"Truman said: ""See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.""
Marlon said: ""So when are you leaving?""
Truman said: ""It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...""
Marlon said: ""Nursery?""
Truman said: ""<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that."""
"Marlon said: ""Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.""
Truman said: ""Yeah, what happened?""
Marlon said: ""I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the ""Burbank"" name.""
Truman said: ""You think so?""
Marlon said: ""Trust me."""
"Truman said: ""You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?""
Marlon said: ""Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?""
Truman said: ""I can't tonight."""
"Truman said: ""Marlon--""
Marlon said: ""--Truman, what are you doing here?"""
"Truman said: ""I've got to talk to you.""
Marlon said: ""Sorry, I'm way behind.""
Truman said: ""I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.""
Marlon said: ""Are you okay?  You look like shit.""
Truman said: ""I think I'm mixed up in something.""
Marlon said: ""<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?""
Truman said: ""There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?""
Marlon said: ""No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...""
Truman said: ""I think it's got something to do with my dad.""
Marlon said: ""Your Dad?!""
Truman said: ""I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.""
Marlon said: ""Who?""
Truman said: ""It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.""
Marlon said: ""How about them?""
Truman said: ""Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?""
Marlon said: ""I told you I can't.""
Truman said: ""I've got to show you something."""
"Marlon said: ""What're we doing here, Truman?""
Truman said: ""This is where it started.""
Marlon said: ""What exactly?""
Truman said: ""Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?""
Marlon said: ""No.""
Truman said: ""When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?""
Marlon said: ""I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.""
Truman said: ""Yeah...""
Marlon said: ""That's the ""Big Guy"".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.""
Truman said: ""Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.""
Marlon said: ""Really?"""
"Truman said: ""Stay where you are!""
Marlon said: ""Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you."""
"Truman said: ""I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.""
Marlon said: ""It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on ""Seahaven Tonight""?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?""
Truman said: ""This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it."""
"Marlon said: ""And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>""
Truman said: ""So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?""
Marlon said: ""Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.""
Truman said: ""What's that?""
Marlon said: ""The thing that started all of this."""
"Truman said: ""...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?""
Meryl said: ""Truman, you're gonna be late!"""
"Truman said: ""What's that?""
Meryl said: ""It's a surprise."""
"Meryl said: ""Well, what do you think?""
Truman said: ""They're...  perfect.  Thank you."""
"Meryl said: ""Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a ""Chef's-Mate.""  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.""
Truman said: ""Gee, that's great."""
"Truman said: ""How did it go today?""
Meryl said: ""A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on."""
"Meryl said: ""I was hoping we could have a special evening.""
Truman said: ""I won't be late.""
Meryl said: ""Did something happen today?"""
"Meryl said: ""Where have you been?""
Truman said: ""I've been thinking--""
Meryl said: ""Oh, God.""
Truman said: ""--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.""
Meryl said: ""Every time you and Marlon--""
Truman said: ""--We could bum around the world for a year on that.""
Meryl said: ""And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.""
Truman said: ""Maybe I feel like a teenager.""
Meryl said: ""We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?"""
"Truman said: ""It'd be an adventure.""
Meryl said: ""I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?""
Truman said: ""That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore."""
"Meryl said: ""This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.""
Truman said: ""I think I'm going to stay up for a while."""
"Meryl said: ""What're you doing down here?""
Truman said: ""Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.""
Meryl said: ""I know.""
Truman said: ""How do you know?""
Meryl said: ""Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that."""
"Truman said: ""What did you want?""
Meryl said: ""I made macaroni.""
Truman said: ""I'm not hungry."""
"Meryl said: ""Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?""
Truman said: ""I still want to look over a couple of things."""
"Meryl said: ""I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?""
Truman said: ""Good night, Mother.""
Meryl said: ""See you in a minute, sweetheart."""
"Truman said: ""I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.""
Meryl said: ""I'm sorry, I'm late.""
Truman said: ""What's the hurry?""
Meryl said: ""Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation."""
"Truman said: ""Arrah!""
Meryl said: ""Oh, my God!""
Truman said: ""What do I do?""
Meryl said: ""I don't know--""
Truman said: ""--you're a nurse, aren't you?""
Meryl said: ""Put some butter on it--or ice?"""
"Meryl said: ""I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--""
Truman said: ""I won't be here Sunday.""
Meryl said: ""--we need more charcoal.""
Truman said: ""Are you listening to a word I'm saying?""
Meryl said: ""You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?"""
"Truman said: ""Let's go now.""
Meryl said: ""What?!"""
"Truman said: ""Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?""
Meryl said: ""You hate gambling.""
Truman said: ""That's right.  I do, don't I?""
Meryl said: ""So why do you want to go?""
Truman said: ""Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?""
Meryl said: ""Truman, I think I'm going to throw up."""
"Truman said: ""Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?""
Meryl said: ""You blaming me for the traffic?""
Truman said: ""Should I?"""
"Meryl said: ""Truman, that was our house!""
Truman said: ""I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.""
Meryl said: ""Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!""
Truman said: ""I think I'd like a little company."""
"Truman said: ""It's hard to go places, isn't it?""
Meryl said: ""There's been an accident, Truman.""
Truman said: ""Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling."""
"Meryl said: ""Truman, I took the ""hypocrite"" oath!""
Truman said: ""I bet you did."""
"Meryl said: ""Truman, what about that sign?""
Truman said: ""I'm sure they're just exaggerating."""
"Meryl said: ""So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?""
Truman said: ""I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.""
Meryl said: ""So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this."""
"Meryl said: ""Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.""
Truman said: ""Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.""
Meryl said: ""That's not true."""
"Meryl said: ""Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--""
Truman said: ""--What the hell are you talking about?!""
Meryl said: ""I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best."""
"Truman said: ""What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!""
Meryl said: ""You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.""
Truman said: ""You're part of this, aren't you?!"""
"Truman said: ""Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.""
Meryl said: ""Do something..."""

Meryl said: ""Truman, stop it!"""
"Truman said: ""--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?""

Mother said: ""Well, I made it through another night.""
Truman said: ""How's your hip?""

"Mother said: ""You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.""
Truman said: ""I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down."""
"Mother said: ""You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?""
Truman said: ""I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?""
Mother said: ""I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?"""
"Mother said: ""It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.""
Truman said: ""It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.""
Mother said: ""About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.""
Truman said: ""They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--""
Mother said: ""--Darling--""
Truman said: ""I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?""
Mother said: ""You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have."""
"Truman said: ""We ought to be getting you back, Mother.""
Mother said: ""Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.""
Truman said: ""It looks so small.""
Mother said: ""Things always do--when you look back."""
"Truman said: ""I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.""
Nurse said: ""I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.""
Truman said: ""Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?""
Nurse said: ""I'll try.""
Truman said: ""Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.""
Nurse said: ""When you get to Fiji?""
Truman said: ""You got it.""
Nurse said: ""Fine.  I'll tell her."""
"Truman said: ""Now what?""
Officer said: ""Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.""
Truman said: ""Is there any way around?""
Officer said: ""The whole area's being evacuated.""
Truman said: ""Well, thank you for your help.""
Officer said: ""You're welcome, Truman."""
"Sylvia said: ""They're coming.  Any minute.""
Truman said: ""Who?""
Sylvia said: ""They're going to stop me talking to you.""
Truman said: ""There's no one here.""
Sylvia said: ""Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--""
Truman said: ""--How do you know about that?""
Sylvia said: ""--And your teacher said, ""You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore.""""
Truman said: ""Were you there--how do you know?""
Sylvia said: ""--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.""
Truman said: ""I don't understand.""
Sylvia said: ""You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman."""
"Tyrone said: ""How's it going, Truman?""
Truman said: ""Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.""
Tyrone said: ""Good.  Good.""
Truman said: ""Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?""
Tyrone said: ""I'd ask for identification."""

The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation."""
"Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""You've got something to show me.""
Dr. Bronschweig said: ""Yes."""
"Dr. Bronschweig said: ""We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""Brought on by what?""
Dr. Bronschweig said: ""Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six."""
"Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""This man's still alive.""
Dr. Bronschweig said: ""Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover."""
"Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""How can this be?""
Dr. Bronschweig said: ""The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process."""
"Dr. Bronschweig said: ""Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.""
Dr. Bronschweig said: ""And if it's unsuccessful?""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""Incinerate it. Like the others.""
Dr. Bronschweig said: ""This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.""
Dr. Bronschweig said: ""Of what?""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""Yes.""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""We have a situation. The members are assembling.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Is it an emergency?"""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""Who called this meeting?""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis."""
"Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Into what?"""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""There are complications."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""Do they know?""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Who?""
Cigarette Smoking Man said: ""Kurtzweil, we think."""
"Mulder said: ""Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?""
Detective said: ""You got some kind of business with him?""
Mulder said: ""I'm looking for him.""
Detective said: ""Looking for him for what?"""
"Detective said: ""Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?""
Mulder said: ""What's that?""
Detective said: ""Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer."""
"Detective said: ""You looking for him for some other reason?""
Mulder said: ""Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination."""
"Detective said: ""You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?""
Mulder said: ""No. Don't bother."""
"Mulder said: ""I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.""
Field Agent said: ""We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.""
Mulder said: ""Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?""
Field Agent said: ""Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.""
Mulder said: ""Have you examined them?""
Field Agent said: ""No. Just fossils, far as I know."""
"Mulder said: ""You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.""
Field Agent said: ""Show you right on a map."""
"Mulder said: ""How's that?""
Kurtzweil said: ""Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding."""
"Mulder said: ""Do I know you?""
Kurtzweil said: ""No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that."""
"Mulder said: ""You follow me out here for a reason?""
Kurtzweil said: ""Yeah, I did."""
"Kurtzweil said: ""My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.""
Mulder said: ""I know the name. Why?""
Kurtzweil said: ""Old friend of your father's."""
"Mulder said: ""How'd you find me?""
Kurtzweil said: ""Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.""
Mulder said: ""You a reporter?""
Kurtzweil said: ""I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.""
Mulder said: ""Who sent you?""
Kurtzweil said: ""I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.""
Mulder said: ""Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab..."""
"Mulder said: ""And what's that?""
Kurtzweil said: ""S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.""
Mulder said: ""He just let it explode.""
Kurtzweil said: ""What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?""
Mulder said: ""The Federal Building was too well guarded.""
Kurtzweil said: ""No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing..."""
"Kurtzweil said: ""Those people were already dead.""
Mulder said: ""Before the bomb went off?""
Kurtzweil said: ""That's what I'm saying."""
"Mulder said: ""Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --""
Kurtzweil said: ""Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.""
Mulder said: ""You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?""
Kurtzweil said: ""And one little boy."""
"Mulder said: ""I think you're full of shit.""
Kurtzweil said: ""Do you?"""
"Kurtzweil said: ""See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.""
Mulder said: ""Not according to the men in blue.""
Kurtzweil said: ""What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.""
Mulder said: ""They want to discredit you -- for what?""
Kurtzweil said: ""For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.""
Mulder said: ""You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.""
Kurtzweil said: ""You know my work?""
Mulder said: ""Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --""
Kurtzweil said: ""I don't either, but it sure sells books."""
"Kurtzweil said: ""I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?""
Mulder said: ""How?""
Kurtzweil said: ""I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.""
Mulder said: ""You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?""
Kurtzweil said: ""According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?""
Mulder said: ""It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.""
Kurtzweil said: ""And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?""
Mulder said: ""Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?"""
"Mulder said: ""What was it?""
Kurtzweil said: ""When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.""
Mulder said: ""What killed those men?""
Kurtzweil said: ""What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.""
Mulder said: ""I'll know soon enough.""
Kurtzweil said: ""What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.""
Mulder said: ""A plague?""
Kurtzweil said: ""The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.""
Mulder said: ""Negotiating with whom?""
Kurtzweil said: ""I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.""
Mulder said: ""And they tell me I'm paranoid.""
Kurtzweil said: ""Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late."""
"Mulder said: ""How can I reach you?""
Kurtzweil said: ""You can't."""
"Kurtzweil said: ""You found something?""
Mulder said: ""Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.""
Kurtzweil said: ""What?""
Mulder said: ""I'm not sure. A virus --""
Kurtzweil said: ""-- You saw this experiment?""
Mulder said: ""What did it look like?"""
"Kurtzweil said: ""What do you think?""
Mulder said: ""A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.""
Kurtzweil said: ""That would be my guess.""
Mulder said: ""Your guess?"""
"Mulder said: ""You told me you had answers.""
Kurtzweil said: ""Yeah, well I don't have them all.""
Mulder said: ""You've been using me --""
Kurtzweil said: ""I've been using you?!""
Mulder said: ""You didn't know my father --""
Kurtzweil said: ""I told you -- he and I were old friends --""
Mulder said: ""You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?"""
"Kurtzweil said: ""You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.""
Mulder said: ""Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.""
Kurtzweil said: ""And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder."""
"Scully said: ""Mulder -- it's me --""
Mulder said: ""Where are you, Scully?""
Scully said: ""I'm on the roof.""
Mulder said: ""Did you find something?""
Scully said: ""No. I haven't.""
Mulder said: ""What's wrong, Scully?""
Scully said: ""I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.""
Mulder said: ""You're looking for a bomb.""
Scully said: ""I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.""
Mulder said: ""I think they have that covered.""
Scully said: ""Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --"""
"Scully said: ""Mulder...?""
Mulder said: ""What happened to playing a hunch?"""
"Scully said: ""Jesus, Mulder...""
Mulder said: ""The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced..."""
"Scully said: ""I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.""
Mulder said: ""How's that?""
Scully said: ""You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.""
Mulder said: ""What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome."""
"Scully said: ""Now what?""
Mulder said: ""It's locked?"""
"Scully said: ""Had you.""
Mulder said: ""No you didn't.""
Scully said: ""Oh yeah. Had you big time."""
"Scully said: ""I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.""
Mulder said: ""Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?""
Scully said: ""I just did. You're buying."""
"Mulder said: ""Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?""
Scully said: ""Something sweet."""
"Scully said: ""Scully...""
Mulder said: ""Scully, I found the bomb.""
Scully said: ""Where are you, Mulder?""
Mulder said: ""I'm in the vending room."""
"Mulder said: ""Scully, get somebody to open this door.""
Scully said: ""Nice try, Mulder."""
"Scully said: ""Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.""
Mulder said: ""Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven..."""
"Mulder said: ""...thirteen fifty six...""
Scully said: ""Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there."""
"Mulder said: ""Scully?""
Scully said: ""Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it."""
"Mulder said: ""Something's not right...""
Scully said: ""-- Mulder! Get in the car!"""
"Mulder said: ""Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.""
Scully said: ""All I told them was the truth.""
Mulder said: ""They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.""
Scully said: ""They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.""
Mulder said: ""What? What are you talking about?""
Scully said: ""I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...""
Mulder said: ""Why?""
Scully said: ""I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.""
Mulder said: ""They were the ones that put us together.""
Scully said: ""Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.""
Mulder said: ""This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.""
Scully said: ""They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.""
Mulder said: ""You're... quitting?""
Scully said: ""There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too."""
"Mulder said: ""I wake you?""
Scully said: ""No.""
Mulder said: ""Why not? It's three AM."""
"Scully said: ""Are you drunk, Mulder?""
Mulder said: ""I was until about an hour ago.""
Scully said: ""Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?"""
"Mulder said: ""What are you implying, Scully?""
Scully said: ""I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.""
Mulder said: ""Is that what you'd like me to do?"""
"Scully said: ""Go home, Mulder. It's late.""
Mulder said: ""Get dressed, Scully.""
Scully said: ""Mulder -- what are you doing?""
Mulder said: ""Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way."""
"Scully said: ""This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?""
Mulder said: ""According to this tag.""
Scully said: ""And you're looking for?"""
"Mulder said: ""It's like jelly.""
Scully said: ""There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous."""
"Scully said: ""And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.""
Mulder said: ""You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.""
Scully said: ""I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either."""
"Scully said: ""You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.""
Mulder said: ""I'd been told as much.""
Scully said: ""You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?""
Mulder said: ""I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.""
Scully said: ""Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.""
Mulder said: ""We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?"""
"Mulder said: ""Why are you whispering?""
Scully said: ""I can't really talk right now.""
Mulder said: ""What did you find?""
Scully said: ""Evidence of a massive infection.""
Mulder said: ""What kind of infection?""
Scully said: ""I don't know.""
Mulder said: ""Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.""
Scully said: ""Mulder --""
Mulder said: ""I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.""
Scully said: ""I've got a hearing tomorrow --""
Mulder said: ""-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.""
Scully said: ""Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --"""
"Mulder said: ""You said you weren't coming?""
Scully said: ""I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.""
Mulder said: ""What did you find?""
Scully said: ""Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.""
Mulder said: ""How was it contracted?""
Scully said: ""That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat."""
"Scully said: ""He didn't mention a park.""
Mulder said: ""This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.""
Scully said: ""I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain."""
"Mulder said: ""You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?""
Scully said: ""The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.""
Mulder said: ""And you've never seen anything like that?""
Scully said: ""No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --"""
"Mulder said: ""This looks like new grass to you?""
Scully said: ""It looks pretty green for this climate."""
"Mulder said: ""Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.""
Scully said: ""All the equipment is brand new.""
Mulder said: ""No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks."""
"Mulder said: ""Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?""
Scully said: ""I don't know, Mulder.""
Mulder said: ""And where are they going with it?""
Scully said: ""That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them."""
"Mulder said: ""What are my choices?""
Scully said: ""About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.""
Mulder said: ""Where would they be going?""
Scully said: ""We've got two choices. One of them is wrong."""
"Mulder said: ""You think they went left?""
Scully said: ""I don't know why I think they went right."""
"Mulder said: ""Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?""
Scully said: ""This is great. This is fitting."""
"Mulder said: ""What?""
Scully said: ""I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.""
Mulder said: ""We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --""
Scully said: ""-- of what exactly?!""
Mulder said: ""That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.""
Scully said: ""They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.""
Mulder said: ""Yeah, well they may this one.""
Scully said: ""What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?""
Mulder said: ""This virus -- it...""
Scully said: ""Mulder --""
Mulder said: ""It may be extraterrestrial.""
Scully said: ""I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.""
Mulder said: ""Been where?""
Scully said: ""Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --"""
"Scully said: ""What do you think it is?""
Mulder said: ""I have no idea."""
"Scully said: ""This is weird, Mulder.""
Mulder said: ""Very weird.""
Scully said: ""Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?""
Mulder said: ""Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there."""
"Scully said: ""Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.""
Mulder said: ""For the purpose of what?"""
"Mulder said: ""You hear that?""
Scully said: ""I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.""
Mulder said: ""Maybe. Maybe not."""
"Mulder said: ""Scully....?""
Scully said: ""Yeah...?""
Mulder said: ""Run."""
"Scully said: ""What are you doing?""
Mulder said: ""Come on!"""
"Scully said: ""Where'd they go?""
Mulder said: ""I don't know."""
"Mulder said: ""What? What's wrong?""
Scully said: ""Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately."""
"Scully said: ""I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.""
Mulder said: ""You can't quit, Scully.""
Scully said: ""I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --""
Mulder said: ""We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --""
Scully said: ""You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --""
Mulder said: ""After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --""
Scully said: ""I have. I did. It's done.""
Mulder said: ""Just like that --""
Scully said: ""I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --""
Mulder said: ""I need you on this, Scully --""
Scully said: ""You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go."""
"Scully said: ""Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.""
Mulder said: ""You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win."""
"Mulder said: ""What? What happened?""
Scully said: ""I think... something stung me."""
"Mulder said: ""Scully...""
Scully said: ""Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm..."""
"Scully said: ""...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.""
Mulder said: ""I think you're in anaphylactic shock --""
Scully said: ""No -- it's --"""
"Mulder said: ""Scully --""
Scully said: ""I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance."""
"Scully said: ""Cold...""
Mulder said: ""Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here."""
"Mulder said: ""We've got to keep moving.""
Scully said: ""Where are we?""
Mulder said: ""You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa."""
"Scully said: ""I can't go any farther.""
Mulder said: ""Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully."""
"Mulder said: ""We're going to the morgue.""
Young Naval Guard said: ""That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.""
Mulder said: ""On whose orders?""
Young Naval Guard said: ""General McAddie's."""
"Mulder said: ""General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.""
Young Naval Guard said: ""I don't know anything about that.""
Mulder said: ""Well, call General McAddie.""
Young Naval Guard said: ""I don't have his number.""
Mulder said: ""They can patch you in through the switchboard."""
"Young Naval Guard said: ""Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.""
Mulder said: ""Thank you."""
"Skinner said: ""Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.""
Mulder said: ""About what?""
Skinner said: ""-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.""
Mulder said: ""She was with me."""
"Skinner said: ""You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.""
Mulder said: ""And they want to blame us?""
Skinner said: ""Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --""
Mulder said: ""But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.""
Skinner said: ""-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --""
Mulder said: ""-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.""
Skinner said: ""She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.""
Mulder said: ""I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.""
Skinner said: ""Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back."""
"Skinner said: ""Agent Mulder --""
Mulder said: ""Where's Scully?!"""
"Skinner said: ""She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.""
Mulder said: ""Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --""
Skinner said: ""I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.""
Mulder said: ""How deep does this go?""
Skinner said: ""I don't know."""
"Mulder said: ""Are we being watched?""
Skinner said: ""I'm not taking any chances."""
"Skinner said: ""What are you doing?""
Mulder said: ""I've got to find Scully."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""Mr. Mulder.""
Mulder said: ""What happened to Kurtzweil?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""He's come and gone."""
"Mulder said: ""Where's Scully?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""I have answers for you.""
Mulder said: ""Is she alive?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Yes."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.""
Mulder said: ""About the conspiracy?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.""
Mulder said: ""I want to know where Scully is."""
"Mulder said: ""What is it?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.""
Mulder said: ""You're lying.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.""
Mulder said: ""A virus?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.""
Mulder said: ""This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""No! For God sake you've got it all backwards."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.""
Mulder said: ""What do you mean, walked?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?"""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.""
Mulder said: ""That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have."""
"Mulder said: ""But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future."""
"Mulder said: ""Why are you telling me this?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.""
Mulder said: ""What happened to Kurtzweil?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.""
Mulder said: ""Where is he?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk."""
"Mulder said: ""Let me out. Stop the car.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Driver."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.""
Mulder said: ""How?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.""
Mulder said: ""What alien environment?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.""
Mulder said: ""What about you?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""My life is over.  Go."""
"Strughold said: ""We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""More concerns than that?""
Strughold said: ""We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""My god...""
Strughold said: ""The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!"""
"Strughold said: ""We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!""
Strughold said: ""Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.""
Strughold said: ""Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves."""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""Our vaccine may have no effect!""
Strughold said: ""Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway."""
"Strughold said: ""We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.""
Strughold said: ""And Mulder?"""
"Well-Manicured Man said: ""You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.""
Strughold said: ""You need not kill a man to destroy him.""
Well-Manicured Man said: ""No, you need only take away what is most precious to him."""

Miriam said: """"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.""""

Catherine said: ""She thinks I can bring Edward back.""
Miriam said: ""Someday you can.  We all believe that..."""
"Miriam said: ""We've been over this a dozen times.  No.""
Catherine said: ""Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?""
Miriam said: ""I don't want to find out."""
"Catherine said: ""Miriam...""
Miriam said: ""Shush."""
"Catherine said: ""He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.""
Miriam said: ""I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.""
Catherine said: ""It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.""
Miriam said: ""If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.""
Catherine said: ""I do it all the time!""
Miriam said: ""Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...""
Catherine said: ""I'd be there for him.""
Miriam said: ""And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.""
Catherine said: ""Okay, okay..."""
"Miriam said: ""You're sure?  Any more nightmares?""
Catherine said: ""No.""
Miriam said: ""Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.""
Catherine said: ""Yes mother.""
Miriam said: ""I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here."""
"Miriam said: ""Don't bring it home in this.""
Catherine said: ""Okay."""
"Miriam said: ""Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?""

Miriam said: ""That's my girl."""
"Miriam said: ""Sing a song of sixpence.""
Catherine said: ""A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?""
Miriam said: ""Nothing.""
Catherine said: ""Why did we stop?"""
"Catherine said: ""The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?""
Miriam said: ""Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.""
Catherine said: ""Like a New Year's Day hangover.""
Miriam said: ""He needs to be turned over."""
"Miriam said: ""This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.""
Catherine said: ""I'll be fine.""
Miriam said: ""She said convincingly."""
"Miriam said: ""Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...""
Catherine said: ""No.  No."""

Miriam said: ""What happened?"""

Miriam said: ""Four and twenty blackbirds...""
Catherine said: ""Baked in a pie."""
"Miriam said: ""Damn him.""
Catherine said: ""What's wrong?""
Miriam said: ""Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him."""
"Miriam said: ""I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...""
Catherine said: ""I don't need them anymore...""
Miriam said: ""I know."""
"Miriam said: ""I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.""
Catherine said: ""Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...""
Miriam said: ""...give a kiss to Edward.""
Catherine said: ""Give a kiss to Edward."""
"Catherine said: ""What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was ""normal?""  Conscious.  How far would you go?""
Novak said: ""As far as I needed."""
"Novak said: ""There's always a chance they'll confess.""
Catherine said: ""Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?""
Novak said: ""Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...""
Catherine said: ""Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am."""
"Novak said: ""I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some ""troubled kid"" you're dealing with.""
Catherine said: ""I realize that...""
Novak said: ""How hard could it be...?"""
"Novak said: ""This man is deeply disturbed, he...""
Catherine said: ""You don't know the procedure.""
Novak said: ""I know him."""
"Novak said: ""Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.""
Catherine said: ""Do you think that's funny?""
Novak said: ""No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I""m here, isn't that right?"""
"Novak said: ""I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...""
Catherine said: ""It doesn't have much to do with science.""
Novak said: ""What then?""
Catherine said: ""The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.""
Novak said: ""Ah, the part of us that can't be explained."""
"Catherine said: ""Agent Novak?""
Novak said: ""Peter, okay?""
Catherine said: ""Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?"""
"Novak said: ""Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.""
Catherine said: ""Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.""
Novak said: ""That's what therapists are for, right?"""
"Catherine said: ""With Stargher I saw things...""
Novak said: ""What did you see?""
Catherine said: ""A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here."""
"Catherine said: ""Why'd you bring him here?""
Novak said: ""You're the shrink, you tell me.""
Catherine said: ""As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me."""
"Catherine said: ""You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.""
Novak said: ""I did, yeah.""
Catherine said: ""You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself."""
"Novak said: ""What about Julia?""
Catherine said: ""This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.""
Novak said: ""You think you can do this, don't you?""
Catherine said: ""He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.""
Novak said: ""This is Stargher we're talking about?""
Catherine said: ""Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.""
Novak said: ""Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?""
Catherine said: ""Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.""
Novak said: ""It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like ""remorse.""""
Catherine said: ""Then what is he?""
Novak said: ""Evil.""
Catherine said: ""If you believe that.""
Novak said: ""Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.""
Catherine said: ""What happened to Charles Gish?"""
"Catherine said: ""What happened?""
Novak said: ""What difference does it make...?""
Catherine said: ""Tell me."""
"Novak said: ""A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.""
Catherine said: ""You're sure of that?""
Novak said: ""Yes.  I am."""
"Novak said: ""Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.""
Catherine said: ""Okay, okay..."""
"Catherine said: ""Wait...""
Novak said: ""Like hell ""wait."""""
"Catherine said: ""He wants us to follow.  The little boy...""
Novak said: ""Little boy?!  That's him!""
Catherine said: ""He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him."""
"Novak said: ""Where the hell are we?""
Catherine said: ""Carl, do you know?  Like on a map..."""
"Novak said: ""COME ON!""
Catherine said: ""I can't leave him!"""
"Novak said: ""That went well.""
Catherine said: ""Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine."""
"Novak said: ""You sure about this?""
Catherine said: ""Absolutely.  Abigail..."""
"Catherine said: ""I heard Julia and John got married.""
Novak said: ""Yep.  Eloped.""
Catherine said: ""Good for them."""
"Novak said: ""Well look at that.""
Catherine said: ""I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...""
Novak said: ""So you say."""
"Catherine said: ""He's mine?""
Novak said: ""All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had."""
"Novak said: ""He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.""
Catherine said: ""It doesn't matter...""
Novak said: ""I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time."""
"Catherine said: ""They're hungry.""
Novak said: ""I got it."""
"Catherine said: ""Thank you.""
Novak said: ""No problem.""
Catherine said: ""No.  Thank you."""
"Edward said: ""You liked him?""
Catherine said: ""He's beautiful..."""

Edward said: ""'s broken."""

Edward said: ""Mocky-Lock.""
Catherine said: ""Oh no... No you don't.""
Edward said: """"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.""""
Catherine said: ""I bet we can fix it."""
"Cole said: ""She the one from Santa Cruz?""
Novak said: ""Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter."""
"Cole said: ""Agent Cole.""
Novak said: ""I need you to find something in the basement...""
Cole said: ""Already there.""
Novak said: ""That hoist, with the winch..."""
"Cole said: ""Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.""
Novak said: ""Delano?""
Cole said: ""Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?""
Novak said: ""You're kidding me.""
Cole said: ""I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious."""
"Henry said: ""Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?""
Miriam said: ""They took care of that, thank you, Henry."""
"Henry said: ""Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.""
Miriam said: ""Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as ""receivers.""  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared."""
"Miriam said: ""Intravenous administration complete.""
Henry said: ""Initiating connection."""
"Henry said: ""That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.""
Miriam said: ""Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry."""
"Miriam said: ""I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.""
Henry said: ""I think that's the whole point."""
"Henry said: ""She changed the codes.""
Miriam said: ""What's wrong?""
Henry said: ""It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't."""
"Henry said: ""Instead of going into his mind...""
Miriam said: ""She's bringing Stargher into hers."""
"Miriam said: ""When did he lapse into the coma?""
Novak said: ""Sometime yesterday morning."""
"Miriam said: ""What about the legalities of this...?""
Novak said: ""Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights."""
"Miriam said: ""Catherine!""
Novak said: ""I'll get her..."""
"Novak said: ""When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.""
Miriam said: ""That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's ""lost.""  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy."""
"Novak said: ""Into Stargher.  Inside...""
Miriam said: ""Yes."""
"Miriam said: ""I have done this, you know.  Been inside.""
Novak said: ""No."""
"Miriam said: ""Nervous?""
Novak said: ""Absolutely."""
"Miriam said: ""I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?""
Novak said: ""Prevacid.  For my stomach.""
Miriam said: ""Any psychiatric medication?""
Novak said: ""No.""
Miriam said: ""What about narcotics?""
Novak said: ""No.""
Miriam said: ""I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.""
Novak said: ""I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.""
Miriam said: ""I doubt that."""

Miriam said: ""Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to..."""
"Miriam said: ""Agent Novak.""
Novak said: ""Dr. Kent.""
Miriam said: ""You're looking well.""
Novak said: ""Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.""
Miriam said: ""That's a secret.""
Novak said: ""Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all..."""

Ramsey said: ""Pregnant.  Thanks for asking."""
"Novak said: ""Here he is.""
Ramsey said: ""Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!"""

Ramsey said: ""Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.""
Novak said: ""No.  Can you get a man close?"""
"Ramsey said: ""We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.""
Novak said: ""They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!"""
"Ramsey said: ""You sure you want to go through with this?""
Novak said: ""What else do we do?!""
Ramsey said: ""I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?""
Novak said: ""I don't have to.""
Ramsey said: ""Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.""
Novak said: ""Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say ""It was all his idea.""""
Ramsey said: ""That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die."""

Curtis said: ""Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues..."""
"Curtis said: ""An investment banking house.""
Mrs. Moebius said: ""He's Jewish? Manzetti?"""
"Curtis said: ""Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.""
Mrs. Moebius said: ""We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already."""
"Curtis said: ""More cultural than political.""
Danny said: ""Obviously.""
Curtis said: ""Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians...."""
"Curtis said: ""That would be a catastrophic mistake.""
Danny said: ""People hate Jews. Do you agree?""
Curtis said: ""They used to. Today it's not an issue.""
Danny said: ""No, but deep down, beneath the ""tolerance"" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it."""
"Curtis said: ""You wouldn't announce it?""
Danny said: ""I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.""
Curtis said: ""But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.""
Danny said: ""Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time..."""
"Danny said: ""Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.""
Curtis said: ""How would you kill him?""
Danny said: ""I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer."""
"Curtis said: ""...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?""
Danny said: ""They're liars and cowards.""
Curtis said: ""I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?""
Danny said: ""It's the truth...."""
"Curtis said: ""Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.""
Danny said: ""What about Mrs. Moebius and...?""
Curtis said: ""They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?""
Danny said: ""A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.""
Curtis said: ""What's that?  Okay. Surprise us..."""
"Curtis said: ""We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....""
Danny said: ""I've been waiting all my life for something like this."""
"Danny said: ""What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....""
Curtis said: ""That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?""
Danny said: ""I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to --"""
"Guy said: ""Is it okay if I record this?""
Danny said: ""No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?""
Guy said: ""I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.""
Danny said: ""What about Curtis Zampf?""
Guy said: ""Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.""
Danny said: ""I agree.""
Guy said: ""The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?""
Danny said: ""In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?""
Guy said: ""It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?""
Danny said: ""What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?""
Guy said: ""My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.""
Danny said: ""German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...""
Guy said: ""Danny, what about the Jews?"""
"Danny said: ""The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....""
Guy said: ""A poison...?""
Danny said: ""Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.""
Guy said: ""Sexuality??? What do you mean?""
Danny said: ""You ever fuck a Jewish girl?""
Guy said: ""What??!?""
Danny said: ""Did you ever fuck one, Guy?""
Guy said: ""What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?""
Danny said: ""And? WHat did you notice?""
Guy said: ""Notice? Like what...?""
Danny said: ""Jewish girls like to give head, right?""
Guy said: ""I don't know. Is that right?""
Danny said: ""And Jewish men like to get it.""
Guy said: ""Everybody likes to, don't they?""
Danny said: ""Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?""
Guy said: ""Why?""
Danny said: ""Because the Jew is essentially female.""
Guy said: ""Female...""
Danny said: ""Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.""
Guy said: ""Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?""
Danny said: ""You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.""
Guy said: ""Danny, what makes you think you know all this?""
Danny said: ""Let's just say I've done due diligence.""
Guy said: ""So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.""
Danny said: ""The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society."""
"Danny said: ""Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.""
Guy said: ""He has Israel.""
Danny said: ""Those aren't Jews.""
Guy said: ""Of course they're Jews.""
Danny said: ""Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he ""universalizes"" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...""
Guy said: ""Are all Jews the same?""
Danny said: ""Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews."""
"Danny said: ""What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?""
Guy said: ""Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?""
Danny said: ""Who? How would I know him?""
Guy said: ""He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.""
Danny said: ""You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?""
Guy said: ""So you're saying it's not true.""
Danny said: ""Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look..."""
"Guy said: ""Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?""
Danny said: ""Do you know who you're fucking with here?""
Guy said: ""That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?""
Danny said: ""Listen to me....""
Guy said: ""Why would Nadelman lie?""
Danny said: ""To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?""
Guy said: ""Give me a reason not to.""
Danny said: ""It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.""
Guy said: ""Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no."""
"Guy said: ""But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this ""destruction"" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?""
Danny said: ""Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God."""
"Guy said: ""Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?""
Danny said: ""No."""
"Guy said: ""Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.""
Danny said: ""What were you, following me?""
Guy said: ""How do you reconcile the two?""
Danny said: ""I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.""
Guy said: ""Explain it so I can.""
Danny said: ""You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.""
Guy said: ""I don't think you know what you are.""
Danny said: ""Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?""
Guy said: ""Who killed Manzetti?""
Danny said: ""If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?""
Guy said: ""It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?""
Danny said: ""Get the fuck away from me."""
"Danny said: ""I always won.""
Miriam said: ""The arguments, anyway."""
"Miriam said: ""Why did you come tonight? To see me?""
Danny said: ""To hear them read Torah.""
Miriam said: ""I thought you hated Torah.""
Danny said: ""That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.""
Miriam said: ""Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking."""
"Miriam said: ""You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.""
Danny said: ""I can't help what I think.""
Miriam said: ""This is me."""
"Miriam said: ""Tell me about Lina Moebius.""
Danny said: ""How did you...?""
Miriam said: ""I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.""
Danny said: ""You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?""
Miriam said: ""Which <i>Times</i> guy?""
Danny said: ""With the shoes... There was more than one?"""
"Miriam said: ""You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?""
Danny said: ""A forty-five.""
Miriam said: ""It was a nine millimeter.""
Danny said: ""You're lying.""
Miriam said: ""So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?""
Danny said: ""I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think."""
"Miriam said: ""All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....""
Danny said: ""But I wasn't.""
Miriam said: ""And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.""
Danny said: ""I can't say that.""
Miriam said: ""Think about your father. Your sister.""
Danny said: ""The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?""
Miriam said: ""Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.""
Danny said: ""Fucking kike."""

Danny said: ""From the Rhineland originally.""
Lina said: ""Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?""
Danny said: ""I was going to ask you the same thing."""
"Danny said: ""Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.""
Lina said: ""Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.""
Danny said: ""We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?""
Lina said: ""So what Jew would you kill first?""
Danny said: ""Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild."""
"Lina said: ""Do you feel you're making progress here?""

Johana said: ""No.""
Bonita said: ""Maybe you should talk to him about it.""
Johana said: ""I can't... I just don't know how to..."""
"Johana said: ""I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan ""You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee""?""
Bonita said: ""But your man isn't quite a God!""
Johana said: ""Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.""
Bonita said: ""Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!"""
"Johana said: ""And you...?  Do you love Enzo?""
Bonita said: ""Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem."""
"Johana said: ""You're leaving?""
Bonita said: ""Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.""
Johana said: ""Of course."""
"Johana said: ""Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.""
Bonita said: ""I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier."""
"Bonita said: ""Did you tell him?""
Johana said: ""Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.""
Bonita said: ""... You take care of yourself, Johana."""
"Duffy said: ""This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.""
Johana said: ""What kind?""
Duffy said: ""Johana, am I boring you?""
Johana said: ""Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?""
Duffy said: ""I said that the file is incomplete."""
"Duffy said: ""Did the driver really freeze?""
Johana said: ""Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.""
Duffy said: ""My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.""
Johana said: ""... So am I."""
"Johana said: ""Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!""
Duffy said: ""What d'you mean?""
Johana said: ""The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!"""
"Duffy said: ""What's happened??""
Johana said: ""The documents are forged.""
Duffy said: ""No!""
Johana said: ""Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!""
Duffy said: ""It can't be true!""
Johana said: ""We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.""
Duffy said: ""I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...""
Johana said: ""I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.""
Duffy said: ""I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?""
Johana said: ""Italian is practically the same thing."""
"Duffy said: ""Good afternoon.""
Johana said: ""I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.""
Duffy said: ""Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.""
Johana said: ""Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?""
Duffy said: ""You're right.  You're fired.""
Johana said: ""Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.""
Duffy said: ""The Italian, I presume?""
Johana said: ""No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.""
Duffy said: ""He seems to have won it.""
Johana said: ""Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!"""
"Enzo said: ""I tell you she's mine!""
Johana said: ""Hello!""
Enzo said: ""You know each other?""
Johana said: ""Yes.""
Enzo said: ""Enzo Molinari."""
"Enzo said: ""This is a great pleasure.""
Johana said: ""Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!"""
"Johana said: ""I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?""
Enzo said: ""It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!"""
"Enzo said: ""A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.""
Johana said: ""I think I'll have a coffee."""
"Enzo said: ""Where did you two meet?""
Johana said: ""In a lake.""
Enzo said: ""I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.""
Johana said: ""Congratulations.""
Enzo said: ""Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort..."""
"Enzo said: ""A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?""
Johana said: ""No.""
Enzo said: ""I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees."""
"Johana said: ""You forgot the Hula!""
Enzo said: ""Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!""
Johana said: ""You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?"""
"Enzo said: ""He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.""
Johana said: ""Have you known him long?""
Enzo said: ""Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.""
Johana said: ""What was he like, when he was little?""
Enzo said: ""Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.""
Johana said: ""I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.""
Enzo said: ""Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!"""
"Johana said: ""And just where are you from?""
Enzo said: ""Italy!"""
"Enzo said: ""Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?""
Johana said: ""No.""
Enzo said: ""He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  ""I'm going to beat you"".""
Johana said: ""... That's what he's here for, isn't he?""
Enzo said: ""Listen to her!  ""That's what he's here for""!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?"""
"Enzo said: ""Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?""
Johana said: ""Okay."""
"Enzo said: ""... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?""
Johana said: ""Congratulations, Enzo.""
Enzo said: ""Don't you agree, Jacques?"""
"Enzo said: ""And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.""
Johana said: ""Enzo, stop bitching, will you?"""
"Johana said: ""Well, good night, then...""
Enzo said: ""You going to sleep here, all by yourself?""
Johana said: ""Yes..."""
"Johana said: ""... It's a comfortable place.""
Enzo said: ""Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.""
Johana said: ""The Mamma's there too.""
Enzo said: ""Yes, the Mamma is is there.""
Johana said: ""Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques."""
"Johana said: ""Is it a poem?""
Enzo said: ""No, it's the recipe for spaghetti ""Frutti del mare"".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!"""
"Enzo said: ""Jacques!  Johana!""
Johana said: ""Enzo!"""
"Enzo said: ""Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.""
Johana said: ""What are you doing here?""
Enzo said: ""Checking out the competition.""
Johana said: ""Enzo, why do you guys do this?""
Enzo said: ""What else is there?""
Johana said: ""You know what I'm talking about."""
"Enzo said: ""You risk your life when you cross the street.""
Johana said: ""Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!""
Enzo said: ""Because you'd laugh.""
Johana said: ""I won't, I swear.""
Enzo said: ""I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him."""
"Johana said: ""A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?""
Enzo said: ""No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.""
Johana said: ""He can learn.  He is learning.""
Enzo said: ""You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?""
Johana said: ""How do you know that?""
Enzo said: ""You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?"""
"Johana said: ""... Not yet.""
Enzo said: ""Don't.""
Johana said: ""Why?""
Enzo said: ""Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?""
Johana said: ""Five minutes and fifty seconds.""
Enzo said: ""That idiot!"""
"Johana said: ""Is he alright?  What happened?""
Enzo said: ""The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?"""
"Enzo said: ""How did it happen?""
Supervisor said: ""The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?""
Enzo said: ""How many are, down there?"""
"Enzo said: ""Ten thousand.""
Supervisor said: ""Lira?""
Enzo said: ""Dollars.""
Supervisor said: ""You're going to hold me up at a time like this?"""
"Enzo said: ""In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.""
Supervisor said: ""What does that mean?"""
"Enzo said: ""Roberto?  How long?""
Roberto said: ""Six seconds."""
"Roberto said: ""Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?""
Enzo said: ""Have the car painted.""
Roberto said: ""Santini will do that for 25 dollars!""
Enzo said: ""Then tell him to wax it too.""
Roberto said: ""Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?""
Enzo said: ""A rosary for Mama, a dress for"""
"Roberto said: ""Yes?""
Enzo said: ""Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol."""
"Roberto said: ""What about the shoes?""
Enzo said: ""Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?"""
"Roberto said: ""Enzo, wake up!""
Enzo said: ""Eh?  Si!  Avanti!"""
"Roberto said: ""The medics are looking all over for you.""
Enzo said: ""I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?"""
"Roberto said: ""Where did you get that?""
Enzo said: """"That""!  This is not a ""that""..."""
"Enzo said: ""Is he here?""
Roberto said: ""He's training."""
"Enzo said: ""Plenty of women everywhere right?""
Noireuter said: ""Smoking is absolutely forbidden.""
Enzo said: ""It isn't lit yet.""
Noireuter said: ""You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!""
Enzo said: ""Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying ""it"" on board?!""
Noireuter said: ""The rules are the rules.""
Enzo said: ""... What's your name again?""
Noireuter said: ""Noireuter.""
Enzo said: ""And where did you say you were from?""
Noireuter said: ""I didn't say...  Brussels!"""
"Enzo said: ""What's with the voice?""
Noireuter said: ""It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.""
Enzo said: ""And... does the voice come back?""
Noireuter said: ""For others, yes... For you, who knows?""
Enzo said: ""Try speaking to me?"""
"Noireuter said: ""Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.""
Enzo said: ""Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?"""
"Enzo said: ""Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?""
Jacques said: ""Fine!"""
"Enzo said: ""You don't mind if I go instead, do you?""
Jacques said: ""No...""
Enzo said: ""If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?"""
"Enzo said: ""Jacques, my friend, how are you?""
Jacques said: ""Enzo..."""
"Enzo said: ""That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?""
Jacques said: ""Yes, I know.""
Enzo said: ""I dove 315 feet!""
Jacques said: ""Great!""
Enzo said: ""They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!"""
"Jacques said: ""Why?""
Enzo said: ""Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.""
Jacques said: ""I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?""
Enzo said: ""No.  All you need is to want to be the best.""
Jacques said: ""You're the best, Enzo!""
Enzo said: ""That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  ""D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete."" So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there..."""
"Jacques said: ""I remember.  Hi Roberto!""
Enzo said: ""What room have you got?""
Jacques said: ""I don't have one.""
Enzo said: ""You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!""
Jacques said: ""It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.""
Enzo said: ""Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!""
Jacques said: ""Enzo drop it, I'll find something."""
"Enzo said: ""... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?""
Jacques said: ""Yes, of course.  Lots of questions."""
"Enzo said: ""Well, what are they?""
Jacques said: ""I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions."""
"Jacques said: ""That's good.""
Enzo said: ""How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?""
Jacques said: ""It's okay.""
Enzo said: ""... You married?"""
"Jacques said: ""No.""
Enzo said: ""Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls."""
"Enzo said: ""So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?""
Jacques said: ""Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!""
Enzo said: ""Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.""
Jacques said: ""People say that?""
Enzo said: ""Forget it.  I was joking."""
"Jacques said: ""No, no!""
Enzo said: ""Not at all!""
Jacques said: ""You're staying at the hotel?"""
"Jacques said: ""Enzo?""
Enzo said: ""What?""
Jacques said: ""Your mother?""
Enzo said: ""Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant."""
"Jacques said: ""Madame...""
Enzo said: ""... And his friend, Johana..."""
"Enzo said: ""C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.""
Jacques said: ""I'm a little tired, I don't know if...""
Enzo said: ""Get in the car!"""
"Jacques said: ""No.""
Enzo said: ""Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!"""
"Enzo said: ""Why?""
Jacques said: ""... For the mermaids."""
"Jacques said: ""Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.""
Enzo said: ""Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.""
Jacques said: ""Why?  Are they what's most important?""
Enzo said: ""No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?""
Jacques said: ""... Everything.""
Enzo said: ""Everything about what?""
Jacques said: ""Well... about everything."""
"Enzo said: ""Why?""
Jacques said: ""If we don't... I'm going to beat you."""
"Jacques said: ""Two years younger than you.""
Enzo said: ""As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.""
Jacques said: ""The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!""
Enzo said: ""Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?"""
"Jacques said: ""Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?""
Enzo said: ""Because pasta should be eaten ""Al Dente"".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit."""
"Jacques said: ""No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.""
Enzo said: ""... I'm listening."""
"Enzo said: ""Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?""
Jacques said: ""Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road."""
"Jacques said: ""Good night.""
Enzo said: ""You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?""
Jacques said: ""What?""
Enzo said: ""The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes."""
"Enzo said: ""Here...  Here...""
Jacques said: ""What is it?""
Enzo said: ""Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!"""
"Enzo said: ""You still collect them?""
Jacques said: ""Yes.""
Enzo said: ""You don't have that one, do you?""
Jacques said: ""No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.""
Enzo said: ""Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto ""He's very good that little Frenchman, very good"".  I lost my title but I won a watch!"""
"Jacques said: ""Can I come in?""
Enzo said: ""No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep."""
"Jacques said: ""He doesn't like us.""
Enzo said: ""So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you."""
"Enzo said: ""... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!""
Jacques said: ""I don't want to erase anything.""
Enzo said: ""You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?""
Jacques said: ""... Yes.""
Enzo said: ""I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.""
Jacques said: ""Thank you."""
"Enzo said: ""Anybody can have a bad day!""
Jacques said: ""I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.""
Enzo said: ""It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?"""
"Jacques said: ""Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!""
Enzo said: ""Thank you, thank you very much!"""
"Enzo said: ""That's good.""
Jacques said: ""Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all."""
"Jacques said: ""... How long was I asleep?""
Enzo said: ""Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?"""
"Enzo said: ""I'm concentrating.""
Jacques said: ""We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while."""
"Jacques said: ""It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.""
Enzo said: ""You say that because you have the title!""
Jacques said: ""No!  I would never cheat you.""
Enzo said: ""Well that's very nice of you."""
"Enzo said: ""You were right.""
Jacques said: ""... I was right about what?""
Enzo said: ""... It is much better down there. It's a better place."""
"Enzo said: ""... Push me back in the water...""
Jacques said: ""I can't.""
Enzo said: ""Jacques, take me back down... Please."""
"Johana said: ""Don't you have a heater?""
Frank said: ""Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?""
Johana said: ""Does anybody live to make a second?"""
"Frank said: ""A drink to warm up?""
Johana said: ""Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.""
Frank said: ""Tea... or whiskey?""
Johana said: ""... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?"""
"Johana said: ""Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?""
Frank said: ""Who?""
Johana said: ""The guy in the Halloween suit!"""
"Jacques said: ""I recognize you.""
Johana said: ""We saw each other a little while ago.""
Jacques said: ""In the lake?""
Johana said: ""No... in the hut."""
"Jacques said: ""Please, have a seat.""
Johana said: ""Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything."""
"Jacques said: ""But what brought you to Sicily?""
Johana said: ""I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous."""
"Jacques said: ""No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.""
Johana said: ""... Okay.  I'll try."""
"Johana said: ""Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!""
Jacques said: ""I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?""
Johana said: ""I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here."""
"Johana said: ""You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?""
Jacques said: ""I don't know... why?""
Johana said: ""Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you."""
"Jacques said: ""Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?""
Johana said: ""I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?""
Jacques said: ""Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?"""
"Johana said: ""I thought you'd be at the dinner.""
Jacques said: ""It's too loud for me."""
"Johana said: ""You look adorable.""
Jacques said: ""Thank you...""
Johana said: ""... Especially the sneakers."""
"Jacques said: ""Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.""
Johana said: ""Lucky I was there to save you.""
Jacques said: ""You jumped in?""
Johana said: ""Only to help the medics, I assure you.""
Jacques said: ""My wallet."""
"Jacques said: ""No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?""
Johana said: ""Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...""
Jacques said: ""Give it to me."""
"Johana said: ""Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...""
Jacques said: ""I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.""
Johana said: ""I'd better get back now.""
Jacques said: ""You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?"""
"Jacques said: ""... No?""
Johana said: ""No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!"""
"Johana said: ""How can you tell it's a female?""
Jacques said: ""... The way she moves."""
"Jacques said: ""She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.""
Johana said: ""How do you know that?""
Jacques said: ""I don't know, I just feel it."""
"Johana said: ""Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?""
Jacques said: ""Uh... Yes, of course!"""
"Johana said: ""Jacques, you set a world record.""
Jacques said: ""I did?""
Johana said: ""Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch."""
"Johana said: ""I'm going back home.""
Jacques said: ""Why?""
Johana said: ""Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.""
Jacques said: ""I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.""
Johana said: ""Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.""
Jacques said: ""But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right..."""
"Jacques said: ""Hello?""
Johana said: ""It's me... Johana."""

Johana said: ""I got fired.""
Jacques said: ""... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too."""
"Johana said: ""So have I.  ... Hello?""
Jacques said: ""I'm still here.""
Johana said: ""Well, then, talk to me some more.""
Jacques said: ""... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.""
Johana said: ""Then, tell me a story.""
Jacques said: ""Uh... Ah!  A story?"""
"Jacques said: ""Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?""
Johana said: ""No... tell me.""
Jacques said: ""You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever."""
"Jacques said: ""Hello?""
Johana said: ""It's me again."""
"Johana said: ""I'm being a pain, huh?""
Jacques said: ""... Not at all.""
Johana said: ""You sure?""
Jacques said: ""Absolutely positive.""
Johana said: ""Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice."""
"Johana said: ""Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.""
Jacques said: ""You'll understand."""
"Johana said: ""Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.""
Jacques said: ""Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?""
Johana said: ""I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis."""
"Johana said: ""And you?""
Jacques said: ""I didn't dive.""
Johana said: ""You'll try again tomorrow?""
Jacques said: ""I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired."""
"Jacques said: ""What?""
Johana said: ""... Nothing."""
"Johana said: ""What are you doing?""
Jacques said: ""I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive."""
"Johana said: ""Jacques...?""
Jacques said: ""You go back, I'll walk."""
"Jacques said: ""What's wrong?""
Johana said: ""It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.""
Jacques said: ""You want to lie down for a while?""
Johana said: ""No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?"""
"Johana said: ""... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?""
Jacques said: ""... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.""
Johana said: ""Why?""
Jacques said: ""Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one."""
"Johana said: ""You've got to tell me what happened?""
Jacques said: ""I saw how it has to be."""
"Johana said: ""Jacques?  I'm pregnant.""
Jacques said: ""That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.""
Johana said: ""You are the father."""
"Johana said: ""Promise me one thing.""
Jacques said: ""Anything.""
Johana said: ""Promise you won't forget me."""
"Receptionist said: ""Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.""
Jacques said: ""... Are you sure?""
Receptionist said: ""Positive, Sir."""
"Jacques said: ""This is the hotel San Domenico?""
Receptionist said: ""Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.""
Jacques said: ""Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?""
Receptionist said: ""No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.""
Jacques said: ""Ah?!"""
"Jacques said: ""You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.""
Uncle Louis said: ""Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques."""
"Uncle Louis said: ""Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?""
Jacques said: ""No."""
"Uncle Louis said: ""Why don't you ask me?""
Jacques said: ""What?""
Uncle Louis said: ""Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!"""
"Uncle Louis said: ""Assassin!""
Jacques said: ""Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.""
Uncle Louis said: ""Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?""
Jacques said: ""I brought Johana to meet you.""
Uncle Louis said: ""Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.""
Jacques said: ""No, no.  Johana is visiting me."""
"Uncle Louis said: ""Where are you from, Henrietta?""
Jacques said: ""Johana... New York.""
Uncle Louis said: ""What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?""
Jacques said: ""He doesn't hear too well."""
"Jacques said: ""Uncle Louis!""
Uncle Louis said: ""No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand?"""
"Uncle Louis said: ""Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?""
Jacques said: ""Well... here.""
Uncle Louis said: ""In my apartment?""
Jacques said: ""It's my apartment.""
Uncle Louis said: ""Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.""
Jacques said: ""Uncle Louis, we have a guest!""
Uncle Louis said: ""I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?"""
"Jacques said: ""Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?""
Uncle Louis said: ""The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!"""
"Uncle Louis said: ""What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?""
Jacques said: ""Louis, we were French!""
Uncle Louis said: ""That's different!  What's the matter with you?"""
"Sally said: ""I changed the lock you son of a bitch!""
Johana said: ""... Sally?"""
"Sally said: ""You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.""
Johana said: ""Again?""
Sally said: ""They got the new T.V."""
"Sally said: ""... And the new stereo.""
Johana said: ""I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?""
Sally said: ""Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?""
Johana said: ""You called the police?""
Sally said: ""They're going to send detectives."""
"Sally said: ""Well?""
Johana said: ""What?""
Sally said: ""How was your trip?""
Johana said: ""Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.""
Sally said: ""Okay... Who'd you meet?"""
"Johana said: ""It's his heartbeat.""
Sally said: ""Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove."""
"Sally said: ""I thought you said he was Peruvian?""
Johana said: ""Haven't you been listening?"""
"Sally said: ""... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.""
Johana said: ""Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight."""
"Sally said: ""... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?""
Johana said: ""Way past it.""
Sally said: ""Does that have a hidden meaning?""
Johana said: ""No.  I'm just depressed.""
Sally said: ""You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...""
Johana said: ""I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.""
Sally said: ""What is it honey... the frenchy?""
Johana said: ""Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.""
Sally said: ""Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?"""
"Johana said: ""What are they for?""
Novelli said: ""They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.""
Johana said: ""If there was a problem, they could do something right?""
Novelli said: ""Of course, that's what they're for."""
"Johana said: ""... And those?""
Novelli said: ""Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.""
Johana said: ""What's that little air bottle on the machine?""
Novelli said: ""That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.""
Johana said: ""But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?""
Novelli said: ""Yes... It's magic."""
"Johana said: ""Who... Who is that?""
Lawrence said: ""Mayol... Jacques Mayol.""
Johana said: ""That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?"""
"Lawrence said: ""... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.""
Johana said: ""I'll have to talk to the driver.""
Lawrence said: ""In the spring when he melts!"""
"Lawrence said: ""My dear, science is a cruel mistress.""
Johana said: ""But... how is he going to breathe?""
Lawrence said: ""He isn't going to breathe."""
"Lawrence said: ""He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.""
Johana said: ""How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?""
Lawrence said: ""It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.""
Johana said: ""Why is he doing this?""
Lawrence said: ""For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew."""
"Johana said: ""Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?""
Lawrence said: ""Coffee might be nice."""
"Johana said: ""Will he understand Spanish?""
Lawrence said: ""His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you."""
"Johana said: ""Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?""
Lawrence said: ""Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?""
Johana said: ""You've made me a happy insurance person.""
Lawrence said: ""Then, goodbye."""
"Johana said: ""Wait!  Professor...?""
Lawrence said: ""... Yes?"""
"Johana said: ""I'll go see how he's doing.""
Lawrence said: ""Let him sleep."""
"Chief said: ""Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.""
Hammer said: ""I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.""
Chief said: ""A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?""
Hammer said: ""Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion."""
"Hammer said: ""I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.""
Chief said: ""What's your first move?""
Hammer said: ""I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more."""
"Hammer said: ""Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.""
Chief said: ""You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?""
Hammer said: ""That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands."""
"Hammer said: ""It was a trap. I'm back at square one.""
Chief said: ""Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.""
Hammer said: ""Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.""
Chief said: ""One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The..."""
"Chief said: ""Mordechai. Thank god you're here.""
Hammer said: ""What's up?""
Chief said: ""About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole."""
"Hammer said: ""Looks like I got a plane to catch.""
Chief said: ""Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.""
Hammer said: ""No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over."""
"Chief said: ""So why the long face?""
Hammer said: ""It's Esther. Santa's got her.""
Chief said: ""My Esther! Oh Mordechai."""
"Chief said: ""Please. Will you help me?""
Hammer said: ""I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission."""
"Hammer said: ""There won't be any need for that sir.""
Chief said: ""Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.""
Hammer said: ""I know sir. I won't let you down."""
"Mrs. Carver said: ""So. Do you have a name?""
Esther said: ""It's Esther.""
Mrs. Carver said: ""From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath."""
"Mrs. Carver said: ""You like my Mordechai, yes?""
Esther said: ""He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me."""
"Mrs. Carver said: ""Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.""
Esther said: ""What do you want me to do?""
Mrs. Carver said: ""He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there."""
"Esther said: ""Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.""
Mrs. Carver said: ""Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you."""
"Esther said: ""Mr. Jefferson Carver?""
Hammer said: ""Please, call me Mordechai.""
Hammer said: ""From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...""
Esther said: ""Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?"""
"Hammer said: ""Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?""
Esther said: ""My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.""
Hammer said: ""How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?""
Esther said: ""Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively."""
"Hammer said: ""Your mother? Oh. Whoops.""
Esther said: ""Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.""
Hammer said: ""I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days..."""
"Hammer said: ""Oy vey, I'm stuffed.""
Esther said: ""I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me."""
"Esther said: ""Any sign of Santa?""
Hammer said: ""He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would."""
"Esther said: ""What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.""
Hammer said: ""C'mon follow me."""
"Hammer said: ""That got annoying fairly quickly.""
Esther said: ""Yeah, no kidding."""
"Esther said: ""So, now what?""
Hammer said: ""Now we wait for Santa to make his next move."""
"Hammer said: ""Want to get a drink?""
Esther said: ""Sure. Why not."""
"Hammer said: ""What was that!?""
Esther said: ""I said, do you come here often!?"""
"Esther said: ""What!?""
Hammer said: ""I said, yeah, about once a week!""
Esther said: ""Oh!"""
"Hammer said: ""Sorry. I'm better with men.""
Esther said: ""Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.""
Hammer said: ""You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it."""
"Esther said: ""Mordechai?""
Hammer said: ""Yes Esther.""
Esther said: ""I want you to talk dirty to me.""
Hammer said: ""Oh. Okay."""
"Hammer said: ""I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.""
Esther said: ""Keep going.""
Hammer said: ""Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism."""
"Hammer said: ""Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.""
Esther said: ""Kiss me you Semitic stud!"""
"Esther said: ""Your mother was right. You do work too hard.""
Hammer said: ""Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?"""
"Hammer said: ""When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?""
Esther said: ""Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so..."""
"Hammer said: ""Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.""
Esther said: ""No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along..."""
"Esther said: ""We do!""
Hammer said: ""I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore."""
"Hammer said: ""What are you doing here?""
Esther said: ""Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.""
Hammer said: ""I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.""
Esther said: ""I forgive you."""
"Hammer said: ""Esther!""
Esther said: ""Mordechai!"""
"Hammer said: ""Esther!""
Esther said: ""Mordechai!"""
"Esther said: ""You two know each other?""
Hammer said: ""We go to the same temple."""
"Hammer said: ""Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.""
Mrs. Carver said: ""I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us."""
"Mrs. Carver said: ""Mordechai. Do you love your mother?""
Hammer said: ""Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother."""
"Hammer said: ""Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.""
Mrs. Carver said: ""When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?""
Hammer said: ""So don't show a picture.""
Mrs. Carver said: ""You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too."""
"Mrs. Carver said: ""I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.""
Hammer said: ""No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.""
Mrs. Carver said: ""Do what you must."""
"Mrs. Carver said: ""Let's let your tuchus breathe.""
Hammer said: ""Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?"""
"Hammer said: ""...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.""
Mrs. Carver said: ""Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos."""
"Hammer said: ""...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...""
Mrs. Carver said: ""...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays."""
"Hammer said: ""Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...""
Mrs. Carver said: ""Mazel Tov!"""
"Mrs. Carver said: ""Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...""
Hammer said: ""...I'm not finished yet, mom."""
"Hammer said: ""Mom! We're eating!""
Mrs. Carver said: ""What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!"""
"Hammer said: ""Happy Hanukkah Tikva.""
Tikva said: ""Happy Hanukkah Morty."""
"Hammer said: ""Okay, what's the information?""
Tikva said: ""She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz."""
"Hammer said: ""Anything else?""
Tikva said: ""Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist."""
"Hammer said: ""But we're not open on Sundays.""
Tikva said: ""I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.""
Hammer said: ""I'll be in my office."""
"Mohammed said: ""So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?""
Hammer said: ""I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?""
Mohammed said: ""Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode."""
"Hammer said: ""Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?""
Mohammed said: ""Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.""
Hammer said: ""Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?"""
"Mohammed said: ""You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...""
Hammer said: ""Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.""
Mohammed said: ""It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother."""
"Mohammed said: ""What's wrong with him?""
Hammer said: ""He's still working out some identity issues."""
"Hammer said: ""It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.""
Mohammed said: ""I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years."""
"Mohammed said: ""Cool. What's it do?""
Hammer said: ""Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter."""
"Mohammed said: ""Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!""
Hammer said: ""But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail."""
"Mohammed said: ""Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?""
Hammer said: ""Oh yeah. Take a look."""
"Mohammed said: ""What are you doing?""
Hammer said: ""Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall."""
"Hammer said: ""Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.""
Mohammed said: ""A stereo type alarm system?""
Hammer said: ""Take a look."""
"Mohammed said: ""How do we bypass it?""
Hammer said: ""The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound."""
"Mohammed said: ""Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.""
Hammer said: ""Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon."""
"Mohammed said: ""What are you doing?""
Hammer said: ""Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget."""
"Mohammed said: ""Hammer, you alright?""
Hammer said: ""Everything's kosher. Watch him for me."""
"Santa said: ""Sorry folks, I don't do couples.""
Hammer said: ""If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.""
Santa said: ""Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?"""
"Hammer said: ""Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.""
Santa said: ""The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive."""
"Hammer said: ""What's your shpiel, Santa?""
Santa said: ""Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls."""
"Hammer said: ""What are you doing?""
Santa said: ""I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer."""
"Hammer said: ""Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?""
Santa said: ""In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year."""
"Hammer said: ""Where's my girlfriend Santa?""
Santa said: ""I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!"""
"Hammer said: ""I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?""
Santa said: ""Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it."""
"Tiny Tim said: ""So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?""
Santa said: ""While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant."""
"Tiny Tim said: ""What should I charge?""
Santa said: ""Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples."""
"Tiny Tim said: ""So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?""
Santa said: ""Worse."""
"Santa said: ""Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'""
Tiny Tim said: ""That's some cold shit."""
"Santa said: ""So, how was I?""
Tiny Tim said: ""It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about."""
"Santa said: ""I wasn't too over the top?""
Tiny Tim said: ""No, it was the perfect level.""
Santa said: ""Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good."""
"Tiny Tim said: ""You okay?""
Santa said: ""No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?""
Tiny Tim said: ""I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir."""
"Santa said: ""Get off of me you cripple!""
Tiny Tim said: ""What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes."""
"Santa said: ""What's going on? Why'd he stop?""
Tiny Tim said: ""Maybe he ran out of ammo.""
Santa said: ""Take a look."""
"Tiny Tim said: ""Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.""
Santa said: ""Resting?"""
"Santa said: ""What day is it?""
Tiny Tim said: ""It's Friday."""
"Tiny Tim said: ""You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?""
Santa said: ""No dipshit, I want you to kill him."""
"Brunton said: ""Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?""
Clo-Clo said: ""Why not?"""
"Brunton said: ""My soninlaw. What do you think of him?""
Clo-Clo said: ""That depends. How much money has he?"""
"Brunton said: ""When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.""
Clo-Clo said: ""I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?""
Brunton said: ""Why not -- if you like it - if that's what you really want."""
"Clo-Clo said: ""Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -""
Brunton said: ""Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?"""
"Clo-Clo said: ""Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.""
Brunton said: ""Good looking?""
Clo-Clo said: ""Mmmyes.""
Brunton said: ""Nice fellow?"""
"Brunton said: ""Is he in love with you?""
Clo-Clo said: ""I don't know -"""
"Clo-Clo said: ""Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!""
Brunton said: ""Drink your beer and don't get so excited."""
"Brunton said: ""This is for ""mama and the kids.""""
Clo-Clo said: ""What about me?""
Brunton said: ""You get your money from your husband."""
"Galbraith said: ""Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.""

"Galbraith said: ""Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?""
Charlie said: ""You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.""
Galbraith said: ""If a leopard didn't do it, who did?"""
"Galbraith said: ""Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?""
Charlie said: ""I drink.""
Galbraith said: ""And when you drink, you get drunk."""
"Galbraith said: ""Then what do you do?""
Charlie said: ""I sleep it off.""
Galbraith said: ""But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?""
Charlie said: ""I don't know.""
Galbraith said: ""That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time."""
"Charlie said: ""Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -""
Galbraith said: ""Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.""
Charlie said: ""And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more."""
"Charlie said: ""Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.""
Jerry said: ""Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.""
Charlie said: ""No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.""
Jerry said: ""You really think so, Charlie?""
Charlie said: ""That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.""
Jerry said: ""They all say the cat killed this second girl.""
Charlie said: ""They don't say it to me.""
Jerry said: ""I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?""
Charlie said: ""Sure.""
Jerry said: ""Let's get in your truck."""
"Charlie said: ""Where's that man?""
Jerry said: ""Up at the museum."""
"Charlie said: ""Sure, I like my leopards""
Jerry said: ""But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl."""
"Charlie said: ""Sure!""
Jerry said: ""No. I'm serious about this."""
"Jerry said: ""Charlie wasn't drunk last night.""
Charlie said: ""Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning."""
"Charlie said: ""I'm sick.""
Jerry said: ""Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.""
Charlie said: ""No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!"""
"Charlie said: ""I don't know. I want to see Robles.""
Jerry said: ""What do you want to see him for?""
Charlie said: ""I want him to lock me up.""
Jerry said: ""Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.""
Charlie said: ""I don't know. I want him to lock me up."""
"Charlie said: ""Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met""
Jerry said: ""You found the leopard!"""
"Charlie said: ""What's left of him.""
Jerry said: ""Where? Where did you find it?"""
"Charlie said: ""North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ""
Jerry said: ""What arroyo - how did you get to it """
"Charlie said: ""And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --""
Jerry said: ""That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --"""

Maria said: "") They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.""
Clo-Clo said: ""They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.""
Maria said: ""All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --"""
"Clo-Clo said: ""What did they say before the bad card came up?""
Maria said: ""You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.""
Clo-Clo said: ""You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.""
Maria said: ""Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-"""
"Maria said: ""Well -- did he give you a lot of money?""
Clo-Clo said: ""Who?""

Clo-Clo said: ""What are you doing that for?"""
"Maria said: ""Something black - something on its way to you ""
Clo-Clo said: ""Go on -"""

Clo-Clo said: ""Let me see it """

Kiki said: ""Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ""
Eloise said: ""You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.""
Kiki said: ""Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!"""
"Eloise said: ""I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.""
Kiki said: ""I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks."""

Eloise said: ""I'll miss you too, honey --"""
"Eloise said: ""Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.""
Galbraith said: ""Good evening.""
Eloise said: ""You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.""
Galbraith said: ""It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.""
Eloise said: ""Oh, that's so interesting!""
Galbraith said: ""Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum."""
"Jerry said: ""Show business?""
Galbraith said: ""Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in ""Zaza."" After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out."""
"Galbraith said: ""Well, I'd best be off.""
Jerry said: ""I want to ask you something."""
"Jerry said: ""It's about the leopard.""
Galbraith said: ""You're worrying about its killing someone else?""
Jerry said: ""Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.""
Galbraith said: ""Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.""
Jerry said: ""You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?""
Galbraith said: ""No. I'm quite sure."""
"Galbraith said: ""There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?""
Jerry said: ""That's right, of course.""
Galbraith said: ""Don't feel so concerned, Jerry."""
"Jerry said: ""Doc -- something you said the other day --""
Galbraith said: ""Yes?""
Jerry said: ""It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city ""
Galbraith said: ""Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?""
Jerry said: ""That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.""
Galbraith said: ""Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.""
Jerry said: ""Why?""
Galbraith said: ""It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.""
Jerry said: ""But it doesn't eat what it kills.""
Galbraith said: ""Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question."""
"Galbraith said: ""Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.""
Jerry said: ""I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery."""
"Jerry said: ""You know Charlie How-Come?""
Galbraith said: ""We're old friends."""
"Galbraith said: ""Come to look around?""
Jerry said: ""More or less.""
Galbraith said: ""I'll take you about. Got some nice things."""
"Jerry said: ""Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.""
Galbraith said: ""About Charlie's leopard?""
Jerry said: ""Yes."""
"Jerry said: ""Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.""
Galbraith said: ""Charlie likes his leopard."""
"Jerry said: ""It could be a man.""
Galbraith said: ""It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies."""
"Jerry said: ""There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.""
Galbraith said: ""I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?""
Jerry said: ""Some crazy guy.""
Galbraith said: ""But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair."""
"Galbraith said: ""We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.""
Jerry said: ""A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!""
Galbraith said: ""Yes, but what sort of a man?""
Jerry said: ""I don't know.""
Galbraith said: ""You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh?"""
"Jerry said: ""Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.""
Galbraith said: ""Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?""
Jerry said: ""Some other time."""
"Jerry said: ""You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.""
Galbraith said: ""Just barely possible - - yes."""
"Jerry said: ""You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?""
Galbraith said: ""But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.""
Jerry said: ""All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --"""
"Galbraith said: ""Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.""
Jerry said: ""If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.""
Galbraith said: ""To the eye? Like other men.""
Jerry said: ""I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?""
Galbraith said: ""He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.""
Jerry said: ""Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?""
Galbraith said: ""No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.""
Jerry said: ""You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you?"""
"Jerry said: ""It was you, Galbraith!""
Galbraith said: ""No.""
Jerry said: ""It was you.""
Galbraith said: ""Not! I tell you. No!""
Jerry said: ""You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --""
Galbraith said: ""I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.""
Jerry said: ""Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?""
Galbraith said: ""It's better you don't know.""
Jerry said: ""Tell me.""
Galbraith said: ""Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --"""
"Jerry said: ""Tormented -- ? Why?""
Galbraith said: ""I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.""
Jerry said: ""Then you found the leopard --""
Galbraith said: ""I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --"""
"Kiki said: ""Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?""
Galbraith said: ""To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up."""
"Kiki said: ""What do you do now?""
Galbraith said: ""There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico."""
"Kiki said: ""Why did you give up teaching?""
Galbraith said: ""Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith  teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself."""
"Galbraith said: ""So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.""
Kiki said: ""Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.""
Galbraith said: ""That was unfortunate.""
Kiki said: ""That was a calamity!"""
"Kiki said: ""Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.""
Galbraith said: ""I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.""
Kiki said: ""Thanks."""
"Kiki said: ""I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -""
Galbraith said: ""Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone """
"Galbraith said: ""Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.""
Kiki said: ""I thought they came right past here ""
Galbraith said: ""They do, but -- there are no lights out there - they'll just be shadows -"""
"Galbraith said: ""Wait ""
Kiki said: ""No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights """
"Robles said: ""You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.""
Jerry said: ""Thanks, Sheriff."""
"Jerry said: ""I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,""
Robles said: ""Go on foot.""
Jerry said: ""It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot."""
"Robles said: ""That's why it just mauls and tears at them.""
Jerry said: ""Something's wrong with this whole setup --""
Robles said: ""Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --""
Jerry said: ""I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --"""
"Robles said: ""What are you getting at?""
Jerry said: ""Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time."""
"Jerry said: ""I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.""
Robles said: ""Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?""
Jerry said: ""No. He was kidding Charlie."""
"Jerry said: ""State hunters?""
Robles said: ""Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars."""
"Jerry said: ""Yes. The lipstick.""
Robles said: ""Why?""
Jerry said: ""Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man."""
"Jerry said: ""Chief, don't you understand what this means?""
Robles said: ""You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.""
Jerry said: ""I'm sure of it!"""
"Jerry said: ""Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ""
Robles said: ""I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them."""
"Jerry said: ""That's a fact, isn't it?""
Robles said: ""Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination."""
"Jerry said: ""You won't go to Galbraith with me?""
Robles said: ""Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie."""
"Kiki said: ""Get it out of here!""
Jerry said: ""Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.""
Kiki said: ""Makes no difference. Get him out!""
Jerry said: ""Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...""
Kiki said: ""That's easy. Me.""
Jerry said: ""I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!""
Kiki said: ""On his back, I suppose.""
Jerry said: ""No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.""
Kiki said: ""You're too good to me.""
Jerry said: ""Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?""
Kiki said: ""No - not yet.""
Jerry said: ""And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.""

Jerry said: ""We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!"""
"Kiki said: ""Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!""
Jerry said: ""Yeah.""
Kiki said: ""And did you find the leopard?"""
"Kiki said: ""It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --""
Jerry said: ""The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night ""
Kiki said: ""Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience""
Jerry said: ""Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you."""
"Kiki said: ""Who is he?""
Jerry said: ""You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show."""
"Jerry said: ""	As long as my feet held out.""
Kiki said: ""And not a sign of the leopard?"""
"Kiki said: ""I can use them.""
Jerry said: ""Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?"""
"Kiki said: ""That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.""
Jerry said: ""He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him."""
"Kiki said: ""Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.""
Jerry said: ""I know. Funerals.""
Kiki said: ""Yes."""

Jerry said: ""You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.""
Kiki said: ""Yes. Do you mind?"""
"Kiki said: ""And she waited here for him?""
Jerry said: ""Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes."""
"Jerry said: ""Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.""
Kiki said: ""Maybe I want to feel badly.""
Jerry said: ""That doesn't make sense."""
"Jerry said: ""What else do you care about, Kicks?""
Kiki said: ""You. Us."""
"Jerry said: ""I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --""
Kiki said: ""Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us."""
"Kiki said: ""Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --""
Jerry said: ""If that's being a softie -- there are two of us."""
"Jerry said: ""Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.""
Kiki said: ""You're positive of that, aren't you?""
Jerry said: ""Absolutely sure."""
"Kiki said: ""You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --""
Jerry said: ""I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this."""
"Jerry said: ""Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --""
Kiki said: ""Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?""
Jerry said: ""I got into a little crap game.""
Kiki said: ""That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --"""
"Kiki said: ""As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.""
Jerry said: ""What! You can't be --""
Kiki said: ""I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --""
Jerry said: ""Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.""
Kiki said: ""All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways ""
Jerry said: ""Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.""

Jerry said: ""I know. What do you think I felt when you said, ""don't be soft?""""
Kiki said: ""Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.""
Jerry said: ""We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I."""
"Kiki said: ""It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.""
Jerry said: ""Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves.

"Lombard said: ""Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.""
Butler said: ""Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir."""
"Deborah said: ""Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.""
Lombard said: ""Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.""
Deborah said: ""That depends what youre looking at."""
"Deborah said: ""Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.""
Lombard said: ""And that is the last time any...""
Deborah said: ""Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought."""
"Lombard said: ""What about you, Mrs De Moraes?""
Deborah said: ""I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.""
Lombard said: ""Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?""
Deborah said: ""Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.""
Lombard said: ""Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?"""
"Deborah said: ""I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.""
Lombard said: ""Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.""
Deborah said: ""For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.""
Lombard said: ""I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.""
Deborah said: ""Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.""
Lombard said: ""Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.""
Deborah said: ""Can it be that easy?""
Lombard said: ""Can it be that you want your brother found?""
Deborah said: ""Anything is possible."""
"Lombard said: ""I found this at your brothers.""
Deborah said: ""Disney! How inter...""
Lombard said: ""Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.""
Deborah said: ""You... You found that at Leons?""
Lombard said: ""Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000."""
"Lombard said: ""You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.""
Deborah said: ""What... What are you talking about?""
Lombard said: ""Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.""
Deborah said: ""Excuse me?""
Lombard said: ""I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?"""
"Lombard said: ""I will of course do my best to hang onto it.""
Deborah said: ""Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?""
Lombard said: ""I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.""
Deborah said: ""Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.""
Lombard said: ""Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news..."""
"Deborah said: ""How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?""
Lombard said: ""The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.""
Deborah said: ""No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.""
Lombard said: ""Excuse me?""
Deborah said: ""Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.""
Lombard said: ""Perhaps I should come back when youre...""
Deborah said: ""No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you..."""
"Deborah said: ""Laurence!""
Lombard said: ""I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes."""
"Deborah said: ""The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.""
Lombard said: ""Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?""
Deborah said: ""Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?""
Lombard said: ""Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?"""
"Deborah said: ""I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.""
Lombard said: ""You drive a hard bargain."""
"Lombard said: ""Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?""
Deborah said: ""Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting."""
"Deborah said: ""You lost my money?""
Lombard said: ""You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.""
Deborah said: ""Who is Friedman?""
Lombard said: ""The man who sold the boy to your brother.""
Deborah said: ""Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.""
Lombard said: ""Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it."""
"Deborah said: ""Are we understood?""
Lombard said: ""You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.""
Deborah said: ""Huh! Really? Hotels?""
Lombard said: ""The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot."""
"Lombard said: ""Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.""
Deborah said: ""W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?"""
"Deborah said: ""You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.""
Lombard said: ""You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?"""
"Deborah said: ""Mr Lombard?""
Lombard said: ""Have you got a pen?""
Deborah said: ""Just a moment...  Go ahead.""
Lombard said: ""The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...""
Deborah said: ""...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?"""
"Lombard said: ""Are you all right?""
Deborah said: ""Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?""
Lombard said: ""Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?""
Deborah said: ""Paul Lamont...?""
Lombard said: ""Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes."""
"Deborah said: ""Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...""
Lombard said: ""Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes..."""
"Deborah said: ""Mr Lombard...""
Lombard said: ""How are you, Mrs De Moraes?""
Deborah said: ""When did you get back?""
Lombard said: ""Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?"""
"Deborah said: ""Im really sorry you were not called...""
Lombard said: ""Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.""
Deborah said: ""I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...""
Lombard said: ""Arent you curious to know about Friedman?""
Deborah said: ""I... If you dont mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?"""
"Lombard said: ""Black suits you.""
Deborah said: ""Sorry?""
Lombard said: ""Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?"""
"Lombard said: ""Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?""
Deborah said: ""You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...""
Lombard said: ""You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?"""
"Lombard said: ""How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?""
Deborah said: ""Youre mad...""
Lombard said: ""Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?""
Deborah said: ""Why... I dont know what youre talking about.""
Lombard said: ""You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?""
Deborah said: ""Have you finished?""
Lombard said: ""When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?"""
"Deborah said: ""You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?""
Lombard said: ""I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?"""
"Deborah said: ""Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.""
Lombard said: ""You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?""
Deborah said: ""Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.""
Lombard said: ""I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...""
Deborah said: ""How... When did you...""
Lombard said: ""It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?"""
"Lombard said: ""Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?""
Deborah said: ""No!"""
"Lombard said: ""What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?""
Deborah said: ""My brother hung himself.""
Lombard said: ""Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.""
Deborah said: ""Leon hung himself.""
Lombard said: ""Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...""
Deborah said: ""Leon hung himself...""
Lombard said: ""Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.""
Deborah said: ""Leon hung himself...""
Lombard said: ""Leon didnt hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell."""
"Lombard said: ""I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.""
Deborah said: ""...You-you spoke to him?""
Lombard said: ""Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later."""
"Lombard said: ""Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...""
Deborah said: ""If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?""
Lombard said: ""Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?""
Deborah said: ""Leon could still have hung himself.""
Lombard said: ""Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too."""
"Deborah said: ""Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.""
Lombard said: ""You dont say.""
Deborah said: ""That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No."""
"Lombard said: ""Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?""
Deborah said: ""I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...""
Lombard said: ""One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?""
Deborah said: ""Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.""
Lombard said: ""I dont.""
Deborah said: ""Good.""
Lombard said: ""Is there anything to understand?""
Deborah said: ""Why do I feel I neednt answer that?""
Lombard said: ""Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.""
Deborah said: ""You bastard...""
Lombard said: ""Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?""
Deborah said: ""You splendid bastard...""
Lombard said: ""Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?""
Deborah said: ""...Were turning in circles.""
Lombard said: ""And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.""
Deborah said: ""Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.""
Lombard said: ""A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?""
Deborah said: ""I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!""
Lombard said: ""What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?""
Deborah said: ""Something like that.""
Lombard said: ""Something like that?""
Deborah said: ""Something like that.""
Lombard said: ""What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?""
Deborah said: ""Here we go again.""
Lombard said: ""Where is that?""
Deborah said: ""Simplify and damn.""
Lombard said: ""Dont you believe in simplicity?""
Deborah said: ""Should I?""
Lombard said: ""We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.""
Deborah said: ""You seem to know what youre talking about.""
Lombard said: ""Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.""
Deborah said: ""My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...""
Lombard said: ""To get me killed...?""
Deborah said: ""I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...""
Lombard said: ""Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.""
Deborah said: ""Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting..."""
"Lombard said: ""You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.""
Deborah said: ""What are you doing? You cant. I...""
Lombard said: ""Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...""
Deborah said: ""He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!"""
"Deborah said: ""Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?""
Lombard said: ""We? You and your parents killed your husband?""
Deborah said: ""No. Not us..."""
"Deborah said: ""They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.""
Lombard said: ""Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.""
Deborah said: ""The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more...""
Lombard said: ""Get to the point, will you...""
Deborah said: ""My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged..."""
"Lombard said: ""So you did talk about it, huh?""
Deborah said: ""On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?""
Lombard said: ""What do you suggest?""
Deborah said: ""I dont know. Everyones dead...""
Lombard said: ""Your parents arranged the visit to my office?"""
"Lombard said: ""Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?""
Deborah said: ""You wouldnt understand."""
"Deborah said: ""I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...""
Lombard said: ""The dead can wait."""
"Directory Enquiries Operator said: ""Directory enquiries. Can I help you?""
Lombard said: ""Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.""
Directory Enquiries Operator said: ""01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir."""
"Directory Enquiries Operator said: ""Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.""
Lombard said: ""A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?""
Directory Enquiries Operator said: ""Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.""
Lombard said: ""Can you tell me how you spell..."""
"Effeminate Waiter said: ""Good morning, sir. How can I help you?""
Lombard said: ""A coffee and a couple of croissants.""
Effeminate Waiter said: ""Crow what?""
Lombard said: ""Croissants.""
Effeminate Waiter said: ""Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?""
Lombard said: ""Croissants. Like that..."""
"Lombard said: ""The word for those things is croissants.""
Effeminate Waiter said: ""Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents."""
"Emily said: ""May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?""
Lombard said: ""Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.""
Emily said: ""Youre a long way from home..."""
"Lombard said: ""You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?""
Emily said: ""I dont smoke. If you could get to the point..."""
"Lombard said: ""Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?""
Emily said: ""Im fine standing, thank you."""
"Emily said: ""Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?""
Lombard said: ""A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me."""
"Emily said: ""I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?""
Lombard said: ""Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...""
Emily said: ""You...  Jesus Christ!"""
"Emily said: ""Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?""
Lombard said: ""French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard."""
"Emily said: ""Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?""
Lombard said: ""The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.""
Emily said: ""By your Austrian?""
Lombard said: ""Yeah."""
"Emily said: ""You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?""
Lombard said: ""No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition."""
"Emily said: ""Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...""
Lombard said: ""Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...""
Emily said: ""There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?""
Lombard said: ""I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me..."""
"Emily said: ""You know where to look for your Austrian, right?""
Lombard said: ""I know where to look.""
Emily said: ""I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wont be for a couple of hours."""
"Emily said: ""Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?""
Lombard said: ""I wouldnt mind. Thank you."""
"Emily said: ""A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.""
Lombard said: ""Hah... What about Nathalie?""
Emily said: ""No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?""
Lombard said: ""Im sure Ill find a way.""
Emily said: ""Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?"""
"Lombard said: ""Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?""
Emily said: ""How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?""
Lombard said: ""Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem..."""
"Emily said: ""Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?""
Lombard said: ""A criminal?""
Emily said: ""Did you not enter this country illegally?"""
"Lombard said: ""Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...""
Emily said: ""Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?"""
"Emily said: ""A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.""
Lombard said: ""Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.""
Emily said: ""Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.""
Lombard said: ""Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.""
Emily said: ""Dont fall asleep with your hair wet."""
"Emily said: ""What am I to do with the packages if...""
Lombard said: ""Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause..."""
"Lombard said: ""Get a pen and dont ask any questions.""
Emily said: ""Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.""
Lombard said: ""Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?""
Emily said: ""Have you found your man? Is that where he is?""
Lombard said: ""I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is. Bye now."""
"Emily said: ""Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?""
Lombard said: ""Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him."""
"Emily said: ""What...?""
Lombard said: ""What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future..."""

Emily said: ""So who... Whos the man? Where is he?""
Lombard said: ""Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.""
Emily said: ""Italian? The Mafia...?""
Lombard said: ""Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime."""
"Lombard said: ""No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...""
Emily said: ""Were both thinking the same thing, right?""
Lombard said: ""Do you know a friendly cop?"""
"Lombard said: ""Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?""
Emily said: ""That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...""
Lombard said: ""Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.""
Emily said: ""A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.""
Lombard said: ""Then find another way.""
Emily said: ""Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?"""
"Emily said: ""Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!""
Lombard said: ""Its up to you whether they walk or not."""
"Emily said: ""...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?""
Lombard said: ""What about your friendly cop?""
Emily said: ""My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks Im obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But hes a good guy. Hell listen to you. He wont turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?"""
"Lombard said: ""Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.""
Emily said: ""You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.""
Lombard said: ""I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?"""
"Lombard said: ""Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.""
Emily said: ""Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ..."""
"Emily said: ""Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...""
Whitney said: ""And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?"""
"Whitney said: ""Hi...""
Emily said: ""If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...""
Whitney said: ""Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen."""
"Whitney said: ""Weve still got the Italian...""
Emily said: ""Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?"""
"Emily said: ""Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!""
Whitney said: ""Emily...""
Emily said: ""No. Youre looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?"""
"Emily said: ""Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!""
Whitney said: ""Shell be alright. Shes tough..."""

Friedman said: ""Have we done business before?""

Friedman said: ""May I have your phone number?""
Lombard said: ""Why?""
Friedman said: ""This is a bad line."""
"Friedman said: ""What sort of puppy are you looking for?""
Lombard said: ""What sort have you got?""
Friedman said: ""Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?""
Lombard said: ""Yeah.""
Friedman said: ""We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?""
Lombard said: ""Yes... Good, good...""
Friedman said: ""So, what are you looking for?""
Lombard said: ""What about an untrained pup, white...""
Friedman said: ""How much of a hurry are you in?""
Lombard said: ""Tomorrow?""
Friedman said: ""Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...""
Lombard said: ""I see. How much?""
Friedman said: ""Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.""
Lombard said: ""... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.""
Friedman said: ""Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you."""

Lombard said: ""Can I have the reception desk, please."""
"Lombard said: ""Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?""
Hyatt Operator said: ""Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.""
Lombard said: ""Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?""
Hyatt Operator said: ""Got it. Puppies."""

Lombard said: ""How are you, Jane?""
Jane said: ""Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?""
Lombard said: ""No.""
Jane said: ""Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.""
Lombard said: ""Good.""
Jane said: ""Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about £100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?"""
"Jane said: ""Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?""
Lombard said: ""La what?""
Jane said: ""La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?""
Lombard said: ""Should I?""
Jane said: ""I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?""
Lombard said: ""That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.""
Jane said: ""So you havent seen the film, then?""
Lombard said: ""Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?""
Jane said: ""Oh... We split up.""
Lombard said: ""Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...""
Jane said: ""Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?"""
"Lombard said: ""Ive got work tonight, Jane.""
Jane said: ""Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!"""

Lombard said: ""Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty."""

Jane said: ""Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...""
Lombard said: ""Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?""
Jane said: ""No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...""
Lombard said: ""Its not.""
Jane said: ""Well, Im sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay."""
"Jane said: ""Piss off!""
Lombard said: ""Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important."""
"Lombard said: ""Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?""
Jane said: ""Your secretary, huh!""
Lombard said: ""Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.""

"Lombard said: ""May I...?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?"""
"Mrs Spitz said: ""Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?""
Lombard said: ""I hope its not too significant.""
Mrs Spitz said: ""What if it is?""
Lombard said: ""Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing."""
"Mrs Spitz said: ""Whatever, you come recommended. We...""
Lombard said: ""Recommended?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Must I speak to you in French?""
Lombard said: ""Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.""
Lombard said: ""Okay. Recommended...""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?""
Lombard said: ""Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.""
Mrs Spitz said: ""What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!"""
"Lombard said: ""I take it your son is called Leon?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that..."""
"Lombard said: ""What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.""
Lombard said: ""How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Do what, Mr Lombard?""
Lombard said: ""Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.""
Mrs Spitz said: ""I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.""
Lombard said: ""I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Then you should not have sought an explanation.""
Lombard said: ""I presume you checked your sons apartment...""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Yesterday. It all looked normal.""
Lombard said: ""Did you look for his passport, driving licence?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.""
Lombard said: ""So he could have decided to go on a trip...""
Mrs Spitz said: ""He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.""
Lombard said: ""Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?"""
"Lombard said: ""I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...""
Lombard said: ""Any friends?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need.""
Lombard said: ""Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""When... Im told he came here..."""
"Mrs Spitz said: ""The £1,000 is on account.""
Lombard said: ""My rates...""
Mrs Spitz said: ""We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.""
Lombard said: ""Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?""
Mrs Spitz said: ""Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate."""
"Mrs Spitz said: ""My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.""
Lombard said: ""Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?"""
"Mrs Spitz said: ""£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?""
Lombard said: ""Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education."""

Mrs Spitz said: ""Jah..."""

Martin said: ""We conclude our transaction."""
"Martin said: ""The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.""
Lombard said: ""Anything at all?""
Martin said: ""Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished?  Theres a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?"""
"Martin said: ""Vous êtes Français?""
Lombard said: ""Does it matter?"""
"Martin said: ""Problems?""
Lombard said: ""Is my money in there?""
Martin said: ""Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside."""
"Lombard said: ""Lets go.""
Martin said: ""I dont know what your problem is, but...""
Lombard said: ""Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate."""
"Martin said: ""Am I supposed to know him?""
Lombard said: ""Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.""
Martin said: ""Clients come and go.""
Lombard said: ""This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.""
Martin said: ""Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble..."""
"Lombard said: ""Where is Friedman?""
Martin said: ""Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?"""
"Lombard said: ""Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?""
Martin said: ""No. In Hampstead... Why?""
Lombard said: ""Dont jump any red lights."""
"Martin said: ""This car needs petrol.""

Lombard said: ""Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go..."""
"Lombard said: ""Is it real?  You people are sick.""
Martin said: ""Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and were out of business.""
Lombard said: ""Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?""
Martin said: ""Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.""
Lombard said: ""Maybe I dont.""
Martin said: ""Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.""
Lombard said: ""Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.""
Martin said: ""Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?"""

Peter said: ""An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?""

Lombard said: ""Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.""

Lombard said: ""Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?""
Rhian said: ""He just said he had good reasons.""
Lombard said: ""Good reasons?""
Rhian said: ""Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.""
Lombard said: ""His mother would be pleased to hear that.""
Rhian said: ""Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.""
Lombard said: ""Im afraid I dont understand.""
Rhian said: ""Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...""

Rhian said: ""The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?""
Lombard said: ""Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?""
Rhian said: ""Er... Yes...""
Lombard said: ""Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?""
Rhian said: ""He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didnt... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another, Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter..."""
"Lombard said: ""The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?""
Rhian said: ""Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...""
Lombard said: ""Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?""
Rhian said: ""... No.""
Lombard said: ""You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?""
Rhian said: ""... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know..."""
"Rhian said: ""He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...""
Lombard said: ""Hows the boy doing?""
Rhian said: ""Fine...""
Lombard said: ""Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch."""
"Old Cowboy said: ""And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?""
Lombard said: ""No...""
Old Cowboy said: ""I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this..."""
"Old Cowboy said: ""Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?""
Lombard said: ""I... How long have I been here?""
Old Cowboy said: ""Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up."""
"Old Cowboy said: ""Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.""
Lombard said: ""Los Angeles?""
Old Cowboy said: ""Los Angeles is 100 miles away.""
Lombard said: ""Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.""
Old Cowboy said: ""Im sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldnt let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise.  And for what its worth, I wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. Id sooner shoot you than have you upset me..."""
"Old Cowboy said: ""Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.""
Lombard said: ""Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...""
Old Cowboy said: ""Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister."""
"Phil said: ""Welcome to the club.""
Lombard said: ""Excuse me?""
Phil said: ""I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?""
Lombard said: ""Uh-huh.""
Phil said: ""No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.""
Lombard said: ""I take it you dont know where he is, then?""
Phil said: ""Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?""
Lombard said: ""I know his work better than I know him.""
Phil said: ""Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.""
Lombard said: ""What about his girlfriend?""
Phil said: ""What about which girlfriend?""
Lombard said: ""Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.""
Phil said: ""Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...""
Lombard said: ""Would you know where I might reach her?""
Phil said: ""Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...""
Lombard said: ""Could that be Camden Market?""
Phil said: ""Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?""
Lombard said: ""Fucked-up fucking weird."""
"Nathalie said: ""Quest-ce que tu veux?""
Lombard said: ""Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents."""
"Lombard said: ""Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!""
Nathalie said: ""Cinq cents.""
Lombard said: ""Viens."""
"Nathalie said: ""Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.""
Lombard said: ""Tu sais où me trouver."""
"Nathalie said: ""Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...""
Nathalie said: ""Où est passé ton salon?""
Lombard said: ""Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.""
Nathalie said: ""Eh bien... Tes sûr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?"""
"Lombard said: ""Alors?""
Nathalie said: ""Alors quoi?""
Lombard said: ""Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?""
Nathalie said: ""A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.""
Lombard said: ""But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.""
Nathalie said: ""Then why dont you reach him?""
Lombard said: ""I dont have your credentials, Nathalie."""
"Nathalie said: ""We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.""
Lombard said: ""If you can, send me a receipt."""
"Lombard said: ""Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?""
The Italian said: ""Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.""
Lombard said: ""Gluck.""
The Italian said: ""Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...""
Lombard said: ""Five seconds. Then you die.""
The Italian said: ""Fuck...""
Lombard said: ""Three...""
The Italian said: ""Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!"""
"The Italian said: ""Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...""
Lombard said: ""The acid bath?""
The Italian said: ""Huh! Youve been around, eh?"""
"Lombard said: ""Why did you kill Friedman?""
The Italian said: ""Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.""
Lombard said: ""Why did you kill him?""
The Italian said: ""Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?""
Lombard said: ""Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.""
The Italian said: ""Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!"""
"Lombard said: ""Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?""
The Italian said: ""If he had, youd be dead.""
Lombard said: ""So why didnt he?""
The Italian said: ""What do you think, huh?""
Lombard said: ""I think youd rather not know what I think.""
The Italian said: ""Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.""
Lombard said: ""So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?""
The Italian said: ""Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?"""
"Lombard said: ""Try again, and this time be polite.""
The Italian said: ""I can only tell you what he told us...""
Lombard said: ""Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.""
The Italian said: ""Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.""
Lombard said: ""What sums?""
The Italian said: ""Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...""
Lombard said: ""Youre sure he said his caller was a man?""
The Italian said: ""Thats what he said..."""
"The Italian said: ""When they realise Im missing...""
Lombard said: ""Shut up and walk..."""
"The Italian said: ""What you gonna do? Kill me?""
Lombard said: ""Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.""
The Italian said: ""Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?"""
"Lombard said: ""Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...""
Moreau said: ""Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?""
Lombard said: ""They lost their son. Why?""
Moreau said: ""It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.""
Lombard said: ""Are they still operative?""
Moreau said: ""Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.""
Lombard said: ""Mossad?""
Moreau said: ""Its a good guess..."""
"Man On Dais said: ""Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...""
Man With Italian Accent said: ""Cost what?""
Man On Dais said: ""Costliest!""
Man With Italian Accent said: ""Whats that? A word?""
Man On Dais said: ""What do you think?""
Man With Italian Accent said: ""I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?""
Man On Dais said: ""Very funny. Can I go on now?""
Man With Italian Accent said: ""Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha..."""
"Charles said: ""Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.""
Aulon said: ""That's a good idea, sire.""
Charles said: ""What do you mean?""
Aulon said: ""Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...""
Charles said: ""... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!"""
"Charles said: ""Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?""
Aulon said: ""My lord, I'm not sure that..."""
"Charles said: ""My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!""
Aulon said: ""Majesty, I can't...""
Charles said: ""Why, are you not ready to die for your king?""
Aulon said: ""Of course I am, it's just that...""
Charles said: ""Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!"""
"Aulon said: ""Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.""
Charles said: ""So... pretend it's not a game."""
"Charles said: ""Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.""
Aulon said: ""Yes, my lord."""
"Aulon said: ""Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...""
Charles said: ""Very generous of you all.  How much?""
Aulon said: ""10,000 gold crowns."""
"Charles said: ""My dear Aulon...  That's fine...""
Aulon said: ""Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!"""
"Charles said: ""It's a miracle she's not dead!""
Aulon said: ""We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...""
Charles said: ""Jean, it's... it's not so easy...""
Aulon said: ""But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...""
Charles said: ""Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?""
Aulon said: ""No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands."""
"Aulon said: ""What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?""
Charles said: ""Tremoille... don't.  Please..."""
"Aulon said: ""Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...""
Jeanne said: ""Do you think I could have some water?"""
"Jeanne said: ""I would like some fresh straw.""
Aulon said: ""Louis... water and fresh straw!"""
"Jeanne said: ""And I would like to see a priest.""
Aulon said: ""Now?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes.  I didn't confess today.""
Aulon said: ""Right.  Raymond... a priest."""
"Jeanne said: ""I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.""
Aulon said: ""Now?""
Jeanne said: ""Better today than tomorrow.""
Aulon said: ""Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do."""
"Jeanne said: ""I also need someone who can read and write.""
Aulon said: ""This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.""
Jeanne said: ""I thought you were an archer?""
Aulon said: ""Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?""
Jeanne said: ""The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there."""
"Jeanne said: ""Who do they think I am?!""
Aulon said: ""Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.""
Jeanne said: ""There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!"""
"Aulon said: ""Jeanne, stop it!""
Jeanne said: ""How dare you stop me doing God's will!"""
"Aulon said: ""He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!""
Jeanne said: ""How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!""
Aulon said: ""Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!"""
"Jeanne said: ""What did they say?""
Aulon said: ""Uh... they said... they will think about it.""
Jeanne said: ""Good.""
Aulon said: ""But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow."""

Jeanne said: ""No, it's... it's nothing, it's..."""
"Jeanne said: ""Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.""
Aulon said: ""I promise..."""
"Jeanne said: ""The king said you're his finest archer...?""
Aulon said: ""Well...""
Jeanne said: ""Come with me..."""
"Aulon said: ""Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes...""
Aulon said: ""It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!"""
"Jeanne said: ""I'll go.""
Aulon said: ""Jeanne, no..."""
"Aulon said: ""Jeanne...!  Are you alright?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?""
Aulon said: ""Because there's an arrow in your leg."""
"Aulon said: ""Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.""
Jeanne said: ""So... what am I supposed to do now?"""
"Jeanne said: ""They've abandoned me... like everyone.""
Aulon said: ""What... what do you mean?""
Jeanne said: ""It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...""
Aulon said: ""Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?""
Jeanne said: ""It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.""
Aulon said: ""But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you."""
"Jeanne said: ""Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.""
Aulon said: ""But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?""
Jeanne said: ""All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.""
Aulon said: ""But how do you know what you hear is the truth?""
Jeanne said: ""I don't know it.  I feel it.""
Aulon said: ""You make it sound so simple...""
Jeanne said: ""The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.""
Aulon said: ""Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!""
Jeanne said: ""So... even you don't believe in me anymore...""
Aulon said: ""Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone..."""
"Jeanne said: ""If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.""
Aulon said: ""Tell me...""
Jeanne said: ""Tell the king to give me more men."""
"Jeanne said: ""That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?""
Aulon said: ""You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart."""
"Jeanne said: ""What did the king say?""
Aulon said: ""He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...""
Jeanne said: ""It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!""
Aulon said: ""Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...""
Jeanne said: ""No, but...""
Aulon said: ""Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?""
Jeanne said: ""Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?""
Aulon said: ""To marry you."""
"Jeanne said: ""I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.""
Aulon said: ""Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!"""
"Aulon said: ""Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.""
Jeanne said: ""I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.""
Aulon said: ""But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?""
Jeanne said: ""But it is what I want.""
Aulon said: ""To be killed in battle?""
Jeanne said: ""If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever."""
"Aulon said: ""Will you at least let me stay with you?""
Jeanne said: ""It would not be the same without you."""
"Aulon said: ""We must sound the retreat!""
Jeanne said: ""Not yet!"""
"Jeanne said: ""Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!""
Aulon said: ""But... why... what's the point?""
Jeanne said: ""Do as I say!""
Aulon said: ""I want to stay with you...""
Jeanne said: ""That's an order!"""
"Jeanne said: ""I am ready now...""
Aulon said: ""Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...""
Jeanne said: ""I'm already free...""
Aulon said: ""Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient..."""
"Jeanne said: ""My gentle Captain... I'm staying.""
Aulon said: ""I -- I don't understand...""
Jeanne said: ""One day you will.""
Aulon said: ""You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and..."""
"Aulon said: ""... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!""
Jeanne said: ""I'm staying, Jean.""
Aulon said: ""No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!""
Jeanne said: ""I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...""
Aulon said: ""Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!"""
"Aulon said: ""Jeanne's alive!""
Dunois said: ""Good.""
Aulon said: ""We have to press home the attack!""
Dunois said: ""Sound the retreat...""
Aulon said: ""But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!""
Dunois said: ""I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!""
Aulon said: ""But that was her order!""
Dunois said: ""I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!"""
"Jeanne said: ""I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...""
Beaupere said: ""You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!""
Jeanne said: ""No...""
Beaupere said: ""Did God forbid you to tell the truth?""
Jeanne said: ""No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you."""
"Jeanne said: ""Go onto the next question.""
Beaupere said: ""Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?""
Jeanne said: ""I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?"""
"Beaupere said: ""Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?""
Jeanne said: ""I tried to.""
Beaupere said: ""It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?""
Jeanne said: ""I don't remember.  Maybe.""
Beaupere said: ""Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?""
Jeanne said: ""I don't know...""
Beaupere said: ""And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?""
Jeanne said: ""No... I said ""Surrender in the name of the King of France""...""
Beaupere said: ""That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!"""
"Jeanne said: ""I can't read.""
Beaupere said: ""Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?""
Jeanne said: ""I leave the answer to God."""
"Beaupere said: ""Do you have a sword?""
Jeanne said: ""Quite a few.""
Beaupere said: ""Didn't you also carry a banner?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes...""
Beaupere said: ""Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?""
Jeanne said: ""I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.""
Beaupere said: ""And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?""
Jeanne said: ""No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.""
Beaupere said: ""And?""
Jeanne said: ""And so I... I prefer my banner.""
Beaupere said: ""Why?""
Jeanne said: ""To avoid killing anyone.""
Beaupere said: ""Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?"""
"Jeanne said: ""No, of course not... I never killed anyone...""
Beaupere said: ""Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?""
Jeanne said: ""No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?""
Beaupere said: ""We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...""
Jeanne said: ""Yes, probably... maybe...""
Beaupere said: ""So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes, but...""
Beaupere said: ""Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?""
Jeanne said: ""No, I... I held it up to...""
Beaupere said: ""You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes, maybe... I don't remember...""
Beaupere said: ""... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?""
Jeanne said: ""No, I... I never killed anyone!"""
"Yolande said: ""It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?""
Bishop said: ""Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis..."""
"Bishop said: ""I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...""
Yolande said: ""And when was that?""
Bishop said: ""Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...""
Yolande said: ""Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...""
Bishop said: ""No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral..."""
"Bishop said: ""W-w-what are you doing?!""
Yolande said: ""Performing a miracle."""
"Buck said: ""Arrest them!""
Cauchon said: ""What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!""
Buck said: ""Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away."""
"Buck said: ""Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?""
Cauchon said: ""She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she..."""
"Cauchon said: ""I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...""
Buck said: ""To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?""
Cauchon said: ""But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...""
Buck said: ""We want her burned as a witch!""
Cauchon said: ""But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...""
Buck said: ""Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!"""
"Cauchon said: ""Calm down, my lord, I beg you!""
Buck said: ""How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!""
Cauchon said: ""Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...""
Buck said: ""So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!"""
"Cauchon said: ""It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.""
Buck said: ""... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...""
Cauchon said: ""But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...""
Buck said: ""Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!"""
"Cauchon said: ""You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...""
Buck said: ""Scared of a girl?""
Cauchon said: ""Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??"""
"Buck said: ""Whose side are you on, Cauchon?""
Cauchon said: ""I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.""
Buck said: ""Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?"""
"Burgundy said: ""So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...""
Jeanne said: ""Am I... am I dead?""
Burgundy said: ""Dead you're worthless, darling.""
Jeanne said: ""Where... where am I?""
Burgundy said: ""Guess."""
"Jeanne said: ""My king will pay any ransom you ask.""
Burgundy said: ""Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.""
Jeanne said: ""God defeated the English, not me.""
Burgundy said: ""And God who allowed you to be caught?"""
"Catherine said: ""Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?""
Jeanne said: ""No no, I'm fine, really...""
Catherine said: ""I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!"""
"Catherine said: ""Really?""
Jeanne said: ""I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?"""
"Catherine said: ""Quick -- hide in here...""
Jeanne said: ""What about you?""
Catherine said: ""Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!""
Jeanne said: ""But where are you going to be?""
Catherine said: ""I'll be right here... I promise."""
"Jeanne said: ""Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?""
Cauchon said: ""I will hear you... but not now, not here.""
Jeanne said: ""Who are you?""
Cauchon said: ""Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.""
Jeanne said: ""Trial?  What trial??""
Cauchon said: ""Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.""
Jeanne said: ""But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?""
Cauchon said: ""It seems that the English care more about you than the French.""
Jeanne said: ""The English??""
Cauchon said: ""Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen."""
"Cauchon said: ""Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.""
Jeanne said: ""I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer."""
"Cauchon said: ""You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.""
Jeanne said: ""I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France."""
"Cauchon said: ""You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.""
Jeanne said: ""I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you."""
"Cauchon said: ""So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?""
Jeanne said: ""My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back."""
"Cauchon said: ""Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?""
Jeanne said: ""In a village called Domremy.""
Cauchon said: ""How old are you?""
Cauchon said: ""Nineteen... or thereabouts...""
Cauchon said: ""Were you baptized?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes.  In the church at Domremy.""
Cauchon said: ""Recite the Lord's Prayer.""
Jeanne said: ""Not unless you hear my confession."""
"Cauchon said: ""Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?""
Jeanne said: ""Not unless you hear my confession."""
"Cauchon said: ""Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...""
Jeanne said: ""And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!"""
"Cauchon said: ""Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.""
Jeanne said: ""These questions have nothing to do with your trial.""
Cauchon said: ""I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?""
Jeanne said: ""Not long ago...""
Cauchon said: ""When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?""
Jeanne said: ""Last night."""
"Cauchon said: ""What were you doing when the voice came?""
Jeanne said: ""Praying.""
Cauchon said: ""The voice was in your cell?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes.""
Cauchon said: ""What did it tell you?""
Jeanne said: ""Many things...""
Cauchon said: ""Did it give you advice?  Good advice?"""
"Cauchon said: ""Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes...""
Cauchon said: ""Is it here?  Now?  In this room?"""
"Cauchon said: ""Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.""
Jeanne said: ""So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?"""
"Cauchon said: ""It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.""
Jeanne said: ""I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?"""
"Cauchon said: ""Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??""
Jeanne said: ""No... I want to be confessed."""
"Cauchon said: ""Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.""
Jeanne said: ""And may I go to Mass?""
Cauchon said: ""As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!"""
"Jeanne said: ""Please... may I have it back...""
Cauchon said: ""You have nothing to regret..."""
"Jeanne said: ""I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!""
Cauchon said: ""Silence her!  Take her away...!"""
"Cauchon said: ""I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?""
Jeanne said: ""And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...""
Cauchon said: ""I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!""
Jeanne said: ""It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul."""
"Jeanne said: ""I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...""
Cauchon said: ""I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry..."""
"Cauchon said: ""Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?""
Dijon said: ""He's feeling wonderful.""
Cauchon said: ""Thanks be to God.""
Dijon said: ""And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?""
Cauchon said: ""Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...""
Dijon said: ""Buying her?""
Cauchon said: ""This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...""
Dijon said: ""I understand.  How much?"""
"Cauchon said: ""20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.""
Dijon said: ""Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?"""
"Yolande said: ""Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...""
Charles said: ""You think?""
Yolande said: ""Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.""
Charles said: ""W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?""
Yolande said: ""Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?""
Charles said: ""You really think she's been sent... by God?""
Yolande said: ""You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head."""
"Charles said: ""You will??""
Yolande said: ""For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson."""
"Charles said: ""It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...""
Yolande said: ""I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...""
Charles said: ""I... I can't stop her."""
"Yolande said: ""Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.""
Charles said: ""But... her army's so small now...""
Yolande said: ""Then her faith will have to be bigger."""
"Jeanne said: ""There's no need to be afraid, sire.""
Charles said: ""I'm... I'm not the king...""
Jeanne said: ""I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon."""
"Jeanne said: ""What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.""
Charles said: ""You did well...""
Jeanne said: ""I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again..."""
"Charles said: ""... and what... what did he say?""
Jeanne said: ""He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France."""
"Jeanne said: ""I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...""
Charles said: ""Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest."""
"Charles said: ""Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...""
Jeanne said: ""... You look wonderful...""
Charles said: ""... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??"""
"Jeanne said: ""Get them out of here!""
Charles said: ""Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!""
Jeanne said: ""Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?""
Charles said: ""Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...""
Jeanne said: ""So how would you put it?""
Charles said: ""Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, ""to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace""...""
Jeanne said: ""Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!""
Charles said: ""Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper..."""
"Tremoille said: ""She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!""
Charles said: ""She says she'll be here tomorrow...!""
Tremoille said: ""You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.""
Charles said: ""What difference does it make where she comes from?""
Tremoille said: ""If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed ""X"".  What sort of name is ""X""?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?"""
"Tremoille said: ""Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.""
Charles said: ""I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?""
Tremoille said: ""The other half."""
"Tremoille said: ""Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!""
Charles said: ""My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?""
Tremoille said: ""Supposing she's an assassin?""
Charles said: ""Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?"""
"Tremoille said: ""Your majesty, I really think you...""
Charles said: ""My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...""
Tremoille said: ""... as always, majesty...""
Charles said: ""... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone."""
"Charles said: ""My captains have sworn their support.""
Tremoille said: ""No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?"""
"Charles said: ""He's probably right -- let's call a delay...""
Tremoille said: ""There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...""
Charles said: ""Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!"""
"Charles said: ""I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?""
Tremoille said: ""Noooo!"""
"D'Estivet said: ""When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?""
Jeanne said: ""If there was, I didn't see it...""
D'Estivet said: ""Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?""
Jeanne said: ""Go and ask him yourself."""
"D'Estivet said: ""You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?""
Jeanne said: ""His face.""
D'Estivet said: ""Does he have hair?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes.""
D'Estivet said: ""Is it long and hanging down?""
Jeanne said: ""I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.""
D'Estivet said: ""But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?""
Jeanne said: ""Go on to the next question.""
D'Estivet said: ""That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!"""
"Regnault said: ""5,000 gold crowns.""
Dijon said: ""That's not a lot.""
Regnault said: ""It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.""
Dijon said: ""I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.""
Regnault said: ""May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?""
Dijon said: ""20,000 gold crowns."""
"Regnault said: ""8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.""
Dijon said: ""I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow."""
"Jeanne said: ""Were you sent by Lord Dunois?""
Dunois said: ""Yes... they were.""
Jeanne said: ""Good.  Where are the English?""
Dunois said: ""Everywhere.  Where is the food?""
Jeanne said: ""It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...""
Dunois said: ""I know...""
Jeanne said: ""Good.  Can you bring me to him?""
Dunois said: ""He's on the other side of the river."""
"Dunois said: ""Wait, wait...""
Jeanne said: ""For what?""
Dunois said: ""Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?""
Jeanne said: ""Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!""
Dunois said: ""Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.""
Jeanne said: ""You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!""
Dunois said: ""Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you."""
"Dunois said: ""So... what is the message?""
Jeanne said: ""We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles."""
"Dunois said: ""Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?""
Jeanne said: ""God."""
"Jeanne said: ""You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.""
Dunois said: ""Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...""
Jeanne said: ""What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!"""
"Jeanne said: """"Be patient, be patient""... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!""
Dunois said: ""Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.""
Jeanne said: ""Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.""
Dunois said: ""Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?""
Jeanne said: ""Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude."""
"Jeanne said: ""Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!""
Dunois said: ""Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?""
Jeanne said: ""Sooner is better than later!"""
"Jeanne said: ""Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...""
Dunois said: ""The wind will be against us...""
Jeanne said: ""The wind will be with us!  Do as I say."""
"Dunois said: ""What's going on?""
Jeanne said: ""We're taking back the Tourelles!"""
"Dunois said: ""Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...""
Jeanne said: ""I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!"""
"Jeanne said: ""Stand by with the battering-rams...""
Dunois said: ""We need another ten minutes...""
Jeanne said: ""The bridge won't wait!"""
"Dunois said: ""Well...?  Shall we go?""
Jeanne said: ""Not yet.""
Dunois said: ""The English won't wait."""
"Xaintrailles said: ""My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!""
Dunois said: ""Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?""
Xaintrailles said: ""The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!""
Dunois said: ""Yes, it's a miracle.""
Xaintrailles said: ""And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...""
Dunois said: ""Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway..."""
"Xaintrailles said: ""But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?""
Dunois said: ""As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome."""
"Gilles said: ""Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?""
La Hire said: ""That'll put fire in my soldiers!"""
"Gilles said: ""God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.""
La Hire said: ""Damn right!""

"Gilles said: ""I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!""
La Hire said: ""Me too..."""

Jeanne said: ""I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger."""
"Jeanne said: ""We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.""
Gilles said: ""But the bridge has been pulled down!""
Jeanne said: ""The English are rebuilding it."""
"Jeanne said: ""Clear?""
Gilles said: ""Perfectly."""
"Gilles said: ""You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?""
Jeanne said: ""No... not like this...""
Gilles said: ""For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!"""
"Gilles said: ""Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?""
Jeanne said: ""I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine..."""
"Gilles said: ""Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?""
Jeanne said: ""Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess..."""
"Gilles said: ""Jeanne... The men are exhausted!""
Jeanne said: ""I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!""
Gilles said: ""Jeanne... we're not enough...""
Jeanne said: ""So... bring up the reinforcements!""
Gilles said: ""Reinforcements?  Where??"""

Gilles said: ""He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...""
Jeanne said: ""But my voices... they promised me...""
Gilles said: ""To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne."""
"Jean Le Maistre said: ""Who told you to wear men's clothes?""
Jeanne said: ""The clothes are not important...""
Jean Le Maistre said: ""You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...""
Jeanne said: ""It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...""
Jean Le Maistre said: ""So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?""
Jeanne said: ""I... submit to Our Lord.""
Jean Le Maistre said: ""But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?""
Jeanne said: ""It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?"""
"Jean Midi said: ""Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?""
Jeanne said: ""I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.""
Jean Midi said: ""Did your voice tell you to jump?""
Jeanne said: ""No...""
Jean Midi said: ""So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?""
Jeanne said: ""No...!""

Jeanne said: ""Yes, but...""

Jeanne said: ""La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!""
La Hire said: ""Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?"""
"La Hire said: ""Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.""
Jeanne said: ""Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river..."""
"La Hire said: ""Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!""
Jeanne said: ""They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that."""
"Jeanne said: ""What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?""
La Hire said: ""God knows, but it was a bad idea!""
Jeanne said: ""Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?"""
"La Hire said: ""I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...""
Jeanne said: ""Don't swear..."""

La Hire said: ""What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!""
Jeanne said: ""Not for long..."""

Jeanne said: ""A few teeth... that's the price of his life?"""

Jeanne said: ""I said, kneel!"""
"Jeanne said: ""You don't believe me anymore?""

"Maitre Maurice said: ""When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes... a half-steed... white.""
Maitre Maurice said: ""Who gave you that horse?""
Jeanne said: ""My king.""
Maitre Maurice said: ""How many did he give you?""
Jeanne said: ""Five steeds and a few hackneys...""
Maitre Maurice said: ""As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?""
Jeanne said: ""No.""
Maitre Maurice said: ""What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...""

Man said: ""I might ask you the same question.""
Jeanne said: ""I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...""
Man said: ""And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?""
Jeanne said: ""Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!""
Man said: ""You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...""
Jeanne said: ""I... I never lied!""
Man said: ""If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...""

Man said: ""How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  ""What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"""""
"Man said: ""That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?""

Man said: ""God asked you to do something?""
Jeanne said: ""Yes... lots of things!""
Man said: ""You mean God said, ""I need you, Jeanne?""""
Jeanne said: ""No, but... he sent me so many signs!""

Jeanne said: ""Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!""
Man said: ""No.  That was a sword in a field.""

Jeanne said: ""Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's ""the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..."" he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?""
Man said: ""Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?""
Jeanne said: ""No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?""
Man said: ""In His name??""
Jeanne said: ""Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!""

"Man said: """"Let all who love me follow me""... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.""
Jeanne said: ""I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?""
Man said: ""No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?""
Jeanne said: ""No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.""
Man said: ""I agree..."""
"Man said: ""I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?""
Jeanne said: ""Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?""

Priest said: ""And what does he say to you?"""

Jeanne said: ""I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!""
Priest said: ""I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.""
Jeanne said: ""Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!""

Szpilman said: ""I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.""
Jehuda said: ""Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God."""

Jehuda said: ""You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.""

Jehuda said: ""There are always notices going up."""
"Jehuda said: ""Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.""

Szpilman said: ""I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...""

Jurek said: ""Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--""
Szpilman said: ""Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...""
Jurek said: ""...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.""

"Majorek said: ""They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.""
Szpilman said: ""If you need help..."""

Szpilman said: ""I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?"""

Combs said: ""You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?""
Granger said: ""Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.""
Combs said: ""Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.""
Granger said: ""Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.""
Combs said: ""We cleared 22 here.""
Granger said: ""Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?""
Combs said: ""They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger."""
"Granger said: ""I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.""
Combs said: ""We'll be waitin'."""
"Duff said: ""Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.""
Twist said: ""You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?""
Duff said: ""Wasn't no problem a mine.""
Twist said: ""He was a con man, wasn't he?""
Duff said: ""He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.""
Twist said: ""Shove off, Duff."""
"Eirie Kid said: ""Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.""
Hooker said: ""Which way did he do, Eirie?""
Eirie Kid said: ""Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.""
Hooker said: ""The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way."""
"Hooker said: ""How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.""
Eirie Kid said: ""Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.""
Hooker said: ""We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.""
Hooker said: ""You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.""
Hooker said: ""There's always a depression on.""
Eirie Kid said: ""If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.""
Hooker said: ""I like griftin'.""
Eirie Kid said: ""You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...""
Hooker said: ""I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?""
Eirie Kid said: ""Forget it."""
"Eirie Kid said: ""I thought you blew all your money.""
Hooker said: ""I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it."""
"Eirie Kid said: ""What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.""
Hooker said: ""Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.""
Eirie Kid said: ""Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but..."""
"Floyd said: ""Doyle, can I see you a minute?""
Lonnegan said: ""I'm busy, Floyd.""
Floyd said: ""It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.""
Lonnegan said: ""Which one?""
Floyd said: ""Mottola.""
Lonnegan said: ""You sure he didn't just pocket it?"""
"Floyd said: ""No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.""
Lonnegan said: ""They workin' for anybody?""
Floyd said: ""I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.""
Lonnegan said: ""All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing."""
"Floyd said: ""We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.""
Lonnegan said: ""What about the other one?""
Floyd said: ""They're still looking for him.""
Lonnegan said: ""Who's got the contract?""
Floyd said: ""Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.""
Lonnegan said: ""Hackers.""
Floyd said: ""They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?"""
"Lonnegan said: ""Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?""
Floyd said: ""Yes sir.""
Lonnegan said: ""Good lad."""
"Lonnegan said: ""I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.""
Floyd said: ""You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.""
Lonnegan said: ""I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.""
Floyd said: ""What do ya want the others to get?""
Lonnegan said: ""Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play."""
"Floyd said: ""I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.""
Lonnegan said: ""What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?"""
"Niles said: ""Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.""
Garfield said: ""I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.""
Niles said: ""Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century."""
"Garfield said: ""Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.""
Niles said: ""All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.""
Garfield said: ""All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.""
Niles said: ""C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.""
Garfield said: ""You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?""
Niles said: ""Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down."""
"Garfield said: ""We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.""
Niles said: ""Does J.J. know how to use this thing?""
Garfield said: ""All he's gotta do is read."""
"Gondorff said: ""Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.""
Hooker said: ""You sober?""
Gondorff said: ""I can talk, can't I?"""
"Gondorff said: ""Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.""
Hooker said: ""Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink."""
"Gondorff said: ""I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.""
Hooker said: ""He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?""
Gondorff said: ""Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.""
Hooker said: ""You mean you blew it.""
Gondorff said: ""Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.""
Hooker said: ""He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.""
Gondorff said: ""No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns."""
"Gondorff said: ""You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?""
Hooker said: ""I picked something up on the way.""
Gondorff said: ""Lonnegan after you, too?""
Hooker said: ""I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.""
Gondorff said: ""You never do, kid."""
"Hooker said: ""Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?""
Gondorff said: ""You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.""
Hooker said: ""I wanna play for Lonnegan.""
Gondorff said: ""You know anything about him?""
Hooker said: ""Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know."""
"Hooker said: ""Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.""
Gondorff said: ""And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.""
Hooker said: ""I'll take him anyway.""
Gondorff said: ""Why?""
Hooker said: ""'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him."""
"Gondorff said: ""You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.""
Hooker said: ""We'll get by without 'em.""
Gondorff said: ""This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.""
Hooker said: ""I never played for winos.""
Gondorff said: ""You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.""
Hooker said: ""You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?""
Gondorff said: ""Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.""
Hooker said: ""Then you'll do it?""
Gondorff said: ""If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got."""
"Hooker said: ""He's not as tough as he'd like to think.""
Gondorff said: ""Neither are we."""
"Hooker said: ""He's waitin' for you in the card room.""
Gondorff said: ""Let him wait."""
"Gondorff said: ""You just worry about your end, kid.""
Hooker said: ""If we ever get to it."""
"Hooker said: ""How'd ya do?""
Gondorff said: ""Well we got some workin' money anyway."""
"Gondorff said: ""Everything go all right?""
Hooker said: ""Yeh, it was easy."""
"Gondorff said: ""No signs of trouble?""
Hooker said: ""What do ya mean?""
Gondorff said: ""You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.""
Hooker said: ""No, not a thing."""
"Gondorff said: ""How 'bout Lonnegan?""
Hooker said: ""I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.""
Gondorff said: ""And?""
Hooker said: ""He threatened to kill me.""
Gondorff said: ""Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em."""
"Hooker said: ""Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.""
Gondorff said: ""Did he hold you up on anything?"""
"Hooker said: ""You think he'll show?""
Gondorff said: ""Did he say he wouldn't?""
Hooker said: ""No.""
Gondorff said: ""He'll show."""
"Gondorff said: ""Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?""
Hooker said: ""I thought I'd lost him."""
"Gondorff said: ""Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?""
Hooker said: ""Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.""
Gondorff said: ""Then why'd ya move outa your room?""
Hooker said: ""It was too noisy.""
Gondorff said: ""You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker."""
"Gondorff said: ""You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?""
Hooker said: ""All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.""
Gondorff said: ""You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.""
Hooker said: ""A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.""
Gondorff said: ""Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me."""
"Gondorff said: ""What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.""
Hooker said: ""Just a little nervous, that's all.""
Gondorff said: ""Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it."""
"Gondorff said: ""Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.""
Hooker said: ""How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?""
Gondorff said: ""Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen."""
"Gondorff said: ""I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.""
Hooker said: ""Then why you doin' it?""
Gondorff said: ""Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting."""
"Hooker said: ""Henry.""
Hooker said: ""Yeh.""
Hooker said: ""I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.""
Gondorff said: ""Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any."""
"Gondorff said: ""You beat him, kid.""
Hooker said: ""You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.""
Gondorff said: ""You wanta wait for your share?""
Hooker said: ""Naw, I'd just blow it."""
"Niles said: ""He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.""
Gondorff said: ""Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.""
Niles said: ""The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.""
Gondorff said: ""Fancies himself a gambler, huh?"""
"Gondorff said: ""We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.""
Niles said: ""The wire is ten years outa date.""
Gondorff said: ""That's why he won't know it."""
"Niles said: ""All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.""
Gondorff said: ""I also gotta win."""
"Gondorff said: ""He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?""
Niles said: ""Not enough to cover a bet that big.""
Gondorff said: ""Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out."""
"Niles said: ""Looks like he's sulking.""
Gondorff said: ""If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever."""
"Gondorff said: ""What's the problem?""
Niles said: ""He wants to put a half million on Syphon."""
"Singleton said: ""Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.""
Gondorff said: ""Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?"""
"Singleton said: ""I'm not sure I know it.""
Gondorff said: ""We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?"""
"Singleton said: ""You in?""
Gondorff said: ""Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?""
Singleton said: ""He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.""
Gondorff said: ""Nice work, J.J."""
"Singleton said: ""Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.""
Gondorff said: ""That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em."""
"Gondorff said: ""How ya doin'?""
Singleton said: ""Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'."""
"Gondorff said: ""Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.""
Lonnegan said: ""Lonnegan."""
"Lonnegan said: ""Raise 500.""
Gondorff said: ""See ya and raise three.""
Lonnegan said: ""See and raise five.""
Gondorff said: ""Five and call."""
"Gondorff said: ""Raise 300.""
Lonnegan said: ""Pass."""
"Gondorff said: ""Raise 1,000.""
Lonnegan said: ""Raise 500."""
"Lonnegan said: ""See and raise 1,000.""
Gondorff said: ""Raise 5,000."""
"Lonnegan said: ""I guess I left it in my room.""
Gondorff said: ""What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money."""
"Gondorff said: ""Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.""
Lonnegan said: ""The name is Lonnegan.""
Gondorff said: ""Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have."""
"Gondorff said: ""I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.""
Lonnegan said: ""If ya win it could make ya, too.""
Gondorff said: ""What are the odds on Syphon?"""
"Gondorff said: ""A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.""
Lonnegan said: ""You're more gutless than I thought."""
"Hooker said: ""She coulda killed me last night.""
Gunman said: ""Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.""
Hooker said: ""Who are you?""
Gunman said: ""Gondorff asked me to look after ya.""
Hooker said: ""How do I know you're tellin' the truth.""
Gunman said: ""Don't have much choice, do ya?"""
"Hooker said: ""Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?""
Snyder said: ""You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.""
Hooker said: ""Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll."""
"Snyder said: ""I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.""
Hooker said: ""You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.""
Snyder said: ""Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.""
Hooker said: ""I'll square it with the fixer.""
Snyder said: ""Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya."""
"Hooker said: ""My end was only one.""
Snyder said: ""Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere."""
"Hooker said: ""Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.""
Man said: ""What for?  I haven't done anything.""
Hooker said: ""We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?""
Man said: ""Yes, a ticket to Chicago."""
"Hooker said: ""Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?""
Man said: ""But I got a train to make.""
Hooker said: ""It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.""
Man said: ""But what about all these other people?""
Hooker said: ""We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes."""
"Man said: ""I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.""
Hooker said: ""All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.""
Man said: ""Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.""
Hooker said: ""Think nothin' of it."""
"Loretta said: ""You done?""
Hooker said: ""Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.""
Loretta said: ""It isn't any better.""
Hooker said: ""Where's June today?""
Loretta said: ""She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.""
Hooker said: ""Where you goin'?""
Loretta said: ""I don't know.  Depends what train I get on."""
"Hooker said: ""Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.""
Loretta said: ""Sixty-five."""
"Hooker said: ""What time you get off work here?""
Loretta said: ""2:00 A.M.""
Hooker said: ""You doin' anything tonight?""
Loretta said: ""Yeh, sleepin'."""
"Hooker said: ""You got a back door to this place?""
Loretta said: ""No.  What's wrong with the front?""
Hooker said: ""Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?""
Loretta said: ""No.""
Hooker said: ""All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.""
Loretta said: ""What the hell for?""
Hooker said: ""Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake."""
"Loretta said: ""What does this guy want?""
Hooker said: ""He'd like to kill me."""
"Loretta said: ""Looks like he missed ya.""
Hooker said: ""Yeh, this time anyway."""
"Hooker said: ""I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.""
Loretta said: ""You move right along, don't ya.""
Hooker said: ""I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.""
Loretta said: ""And you expect me to come over, just like that.""
Hooker said: ""If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall."""
"Loretta said: ""I don't even know you.""
Hooker said: ""You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody."""
"Hooker said: ""You sure it'll be one of these two?""
Twist said: ""No.  They're just the only ones we know of."""
"Hooker said: ""Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.""
Twist said: ""All right, when?""
Hooker said: ""Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.""
Twist said: ""Okay, Tootsie."""
"Hooker said: ""Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.""
Twist said: ""What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.""
Hooker said: ""I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.""
Twist said: ""Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted."""
"Jimmy said: ""Hooker!""
Hooker said: ""How ya doin', Jimmy."""
"Jimmy said: ""Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.""
Hooker said: ""Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.""
Jimmy said: ""You gonna have a go here?  How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1."""
"Jimmy said: ""You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.""
Hooker said: ""I feel lucky tonight.""
Jimmy said: ""Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...""
Hooker said: ""Three grand on the black, Jimmy."""
"Lonnegan said: ""Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?""
Hooker said: ""He cheats."""
"Lonnegan said: ""He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.""
Hooker said: ""Yeh, he knows that.""
Lonnegan said: ""What do you mean?""
Hooker said: ""He hired a dame to take it from ya."""
"Hooker said: ""You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.""
Lonnegan said: ""I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.""
Hooker said: ""So could Shaw.""
Lonnegan said: ""Then why the rat?""
Hooker said: ""Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him."""
"Lonnegan said: ""What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?""
Hooker said: ""Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.""
Lonnegan said: ""All right, then."""
"Lonnegan said: ""Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.""
Hooker said: ""I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.""
Lonnegan said: ""I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.""
Hooker said: ""All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information."""
"Hooker said: ""If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.""
Lonnegan said: ""That's worth fifteen grand to ya?""
Hooker said: ""Maybe a couple million."""
"Lonnegan said: ""You're dreamin', kid.""
Hooker said: ""660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.""
Lonnegan said: ""If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming."""
"Lonnegan said: ""You should always look to the back too, kid.""
Hooker said: ""I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.""
Lonnegan said: ""Get on with it then.""
Hooker said: ""Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.""
Lonnegan said: ""You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.""
Hooker said: ""This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.""
Lonnegan said: ""And you were gonna pay me back?""
Hooker said: ""I am after this race."""
"Lonnegan said: ""You really picked a winner, kid.""
Hooker said: ""Give 'em a little time."""
"Hooker said: ""Well, what did I tell ya?""
Lonnegan said: ""You're a lucky man, all right.""
Hooker said: ""Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.""
Lonnegan said: ""Why don't ya then.""
Hooker said: ""'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.""
Lonnegan said: ""You got a system, Carver?"""
"Hooker said: ""You stayin' in or not?""
Lonnegan said: ""I'm in.""
Hooker said: ""It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it."""
"Lonnegan said: ""You got the 400 grand yet?""
Hooker said: ""Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.""
Lonnegan said: ""I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.""
Hooker said: ""What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?""
Lonnegan said: ""If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more."""
"Hooker said: ""I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.""
Lonnegan said: ""Let me talk to him.""
Hooker said: ""No.""
Lonnegan said: ""You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out."""
"Lonnegan said: ""What happened to your face?""
Hooker said: ""Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring."""
"Lonnegan said: ""A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.""
Hooker said: ""He's right, Les."""
"Hooker said: ""What happened?""
Lonnegan said: ""I didn't get the bet down in time.""
Hooker said: ""Oh, Jesus."""
"Lonnegan said: ""Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.""
Hooker said: ""How am I gonna do that?""
Lonnegan said: ""I don't know, figure something out."""
"Polk said: ""You want a drink or something?""
Hooker said: ""No.""
Polk said: ""We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.""
Hooker said: ""Don't think I know him.""
Polk said: ""Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.""
Hooker said: ""Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit."""
"Hooker said: ""You got nothin' on me.""
Polk said: ""We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want."""
"Polk said: ""Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.""
Hooker said: ""No."""
"Polk said: ""You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?""
Hooker said: ""I'll make parole.""
Polk said: ""Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later."""
"Hooker said: ""Will you wait until the chump is played?""
Polk said: ""Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.""
Hooker said: ""I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.""
Polk said: ""All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.""
Hooker said: ""Just as long as I get to finish the play."""
"Twist said: ""Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.""
Lonnegan said: ""I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.""
Twist said: ""But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.""
Lonnegan said: ""I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.""
Twist said: ""On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.""
Lonnegan said: ""If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.""
Twist said: ""We were getting 50 from our guy.""
Lonnegan said: ""With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40."""
"Twist said: ""Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.""
Lonnegan said: ""Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya."""
"Lonnegan said: ""Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.""
Twist said: ""On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second."""
"Lonnegan said: ""All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?""
Riley said: ""We missed him.""
Lonnegan said: ""You weren't hired to miss him.""
Riley said: ""There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.""
Lonnegan said: ""Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?""
Riley said: ""I don't know.  He took it hard.""
Lonnegan said: ""All right, get outa here.  You're outta work."""
"Twist said: ""We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?""
Old Man said: ""For fifteen years.""
Twist said: ""I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?""
Old Man said: ""Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.""
Twist said: ""This is the last time I expect to see you down here.""
Old Man said: ""Never heard of the place."""
"Snyder said: ""What is this?  I got work to do.""
Polk said: ""Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker."""
"Polk said: ""Do ya know him or don't ya?""
Snyder said: ""Yeh, but I don't know where he is.""
Polk said: ""Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?""
Snyder said: ""Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.""
Polk said: ""There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.""
Snyder said: ""Why don't you pick him up yourself?""
Polk said: ""Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.""
Snyder said: ""Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.""
Polk said: ""Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.""
Snyder said: ""What the hell good is Hooker to ya?""
Polk said: ""He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.""
Snyder said: ""He'll never do it.""
Polk said: ""I think he will."""
"Nick said: ""Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.""
1St Reporter said: ""Come on, gimme a break.""
Nick said: ""I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth."""

"1St Reporter said: ""What about this Rosebreen?""
Nick said: ""Sorry.  Don't know a thing."""
"1St Reporter said: ""What's your next step, Nick?""
Nick said: ""Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.""
1St Reporter said: ""We'll see you before you go."""
"Gilbert said: ""There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.""
1St Reporter said: ""He was?""
Gilbert said: ""Yes.  He admitted it.""
1St Reporter said: ""Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.""
Gilbert said: ""Why not?""
1St Reporter said: ""You know how they are... sex...""
Gilbert said: ""Then just say he was sixty years old.""

Dorothy said: ""He's just around the corner."""
"Andrew said: ""She's got me worrying, too.""
Nick said: ""Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.""
Andrew said: ""Why did that man want to kill him?""
Nick said: ""Said he stole his invention.""

Nick said: ""I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.""
Guild said: ""Trail him!  Trail who?""
Nick said: ""Nunheim!"""
"Guild said: ""Get anything?""
Nick said: ""She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is."""
"Guild said: ""I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.""
Nick said: ""Fifty will still get you a hundred.""
Guild said: ""This is enough for me."""
"Nick said: ""Just rolled them up and threw them in.""
Guild said: ""Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.""
Nick said: ""Extraordinarily lucky."""
"Guild said: """"D.W.R.""  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?""
Nick said: ""Rosebreen.""
Guild said: ""Could this be him?""
Nick said: ""I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.""
Guild said: ""He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.""
Nick said: ""Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...""
Guild said: ""Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?"""
"Guild said: ""What're you doing here?""
Nick said: ""I'll take care of him."""
"Guild said: ""Are you kidding?""
Nick said: ""No.""
Guild said: ""Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?""
Nick said: ""Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders."""
"Guild said: ""You mean that body-----?""
Nick said: ""--was Wynant's."""
"Guild said: ""Shut up.""
Nick said: ""You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?"""
"Guild said: ""When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?""
Macaulay said: ""Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.""
Guild said: ""Seen any signs of it, Bill?"""
"Macaulay said: ""I said he hadn't written me.""
Guild said: ""Oh, then you did hear from him?""
Macaulay said: ""Well....""
Guild said: ""Well, what?""
Macaulay said: ""He telephoned me today.""
Guild said: ""He did!""
Macaulay said: ""I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.""
Guild said: ""When was that?""
Macaulay said: ""About three.""
Guild said: ""Did you go?""
Macaulay said: ""Yes.  But he didn't show up."""
"Macaulay said: ""I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....""
Guild said: ""Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?""
Macaulay said: ""I didn't know they had a fight.""
Guild said: ""Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again."""
"Guild said: ""There are a few things we want to check up on.""
Mimi said: ""I see.""
Guild said: ""You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?""
Mimi said: ""Why yes.""
Guild said: ""Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?""
Mimi said: ""No.""
Guild said: ""Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?""
Mimi said: ""I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.""
Guild said: ""The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed...."""
"Guild said: ""That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.""
Mimi said: ""Goodbye.""
Guild said: ""Goodbye."""
"Guild said: ""You did!""
Mimi said: ""That's nothing.  I saw him myself."""
"Guild said: ""What kind of clothes was he wearing?""
Mimi said: ""A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.""
Guild said: ""Tell 'em."""
"Mimi said: ""That's ridiculous.""
Guild said: ""Let him have his say out."""
"Guild said: ""Good morning --""
Nora said: ""Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry."""
"Nora said: ""But he's interested!""
Guild said: ""I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us."""
"Nora said: ""Do you think that Wynant did it?""
Guild said: ""Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop."""
"Nora said: ""I think we may as well sit down.""
Guild said: ""I guess all the suspects are here."""
"Nora said: ""Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.""
Guild said: ""They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.""
Nora said: ""You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties."""
"Nunheim said: ""Have a shot?""
Guild said: ""What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?""
Nunheim said: ""That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it."""
"Nunheim said: ""She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.""
Guild said: ""Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.""
Nunheim said: ""That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.""
Guild said: ""Want to take a poke at him?""
Nunheim said: ""I didn't mean you, Mister."""
"Guild said: ""You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?""
Nunheim said: ""You don't think I had anything to do with it?""
Guild said: ""Where were you?"""
"Guild said: ""Where were you?""
Nunheim said: ""Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!"""
"Nunheim said: ""Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!""
Guild said: ""Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?"""
"Nunheim said: ""I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.""
Guild said: ""How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?""
Nunheim said: ""Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!"""
"Mimi said: ""Don't mind what she says, Chris.""
Jorgensen said: ""How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.""
Mimi said: ""I'll get some.""
Jorgensen said: ""You've said that for weeks.""
Mimi said: ""I know.""
Jorgensen said: ""Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.""
Mimi said: ""Chris!""
Jorgensen said: ""All right.  All right.""
Mimi said: ""I couldn't go near that woman.""
Jorgensen said: ""I said all right!"""
"Mimi said: ""What are you going to do?""
Jorgensen said: ""Just what I said I'd do.""
Mimi said: ""You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!""
Jorgensen said: ""Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.""
Mimi said: ""Chris -- Chris -- !"""
"Mimi said: ""and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.""
Jorgensen said: ""I thought you said you weren't going there.""
Mimi said: ""Why, you said...""
Jorgensen said: ""Never mind."""
"Julia said: ""We're just having a little drink.""
Wynant said: ""So I see."""
"Wynant said: ""Who's that man?""
Julia said: ""He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.""
Wynant said: ""I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.""
Julia said: ""This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.""
Wynant said: ""I don't like him.""
Julia said: ""Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?""
Wynant said: ""No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.""
Julia said: ""What bonds?""
Wynant said: ""The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.""
Julia said: ""Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.""
Wynant said: ""I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.""
Julia said: ""Don't you remember....""
Wynant said: ""Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!""
Julia said: ""Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....""
Wynant said: ""No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?""
Julia said: ""What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....""
Wynant said: ""That's my business.""
Julia said: ""supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?"""
"Wynant said: ""I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.""
Julia said: ""Go ahead!""
Wynant said: ""They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record."""
"Julia said: ""That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....""
Wynant said: ""Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?""
Julia said: ""I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...""
Wynant said: ""You're going to return every cent of it!""
Julia said: ""I can't! I haven't got it!""
Wynant said: ""What did you do with the rest?""
Julia said: ""I never had it.""
Wynant said: ""Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ..."""
"Nora said: ""Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.""
Macaulay said: ""Yes?"""
"Nora said: ""Oh, hello.  Come on in.""
Macaulay said: ""Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very ""Merry Christmas"" for you.""
Nora said: ""Oh, he's sitting up.""
Macaulay said: ""Good."""
"Nora said: ""Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.""
Macaulay said: ""That's all right."""
"Macaulay said: ""I got word from Wynant this morning...""
Nora said: ""So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here."""
"Nora said: ""Oh, please, Nick.""
Macaulay said: ""Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?"""
"Wynant said: ""Did you get my money?""
Macaulay said: ""I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.""
Wynant said: ""I'm not telling anyone.""
Macaulay said: ""But suppose some business comes up...""
Wynant said: ""That's just why I'm going."""
"Macaulay said: ""One hundred...  two hundred... three...""
Wynant said: ""Never mind.""
Macaulay said: ""I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.""
Wynant said: ""I trust you.""
Macaulay said: ""Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?""
Wynant said: ""No.""
Macaulay said: ""Well, let me do that for you.""
Wynant said: ""You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!"""
"Wynant said: ""Thanks, and goodbye.""
Macaulay said: ""What'll I do if something comes up?""
Wynant said: ""Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?""
Macaulay said: ""Is Julia going with you?""
Wynant said: ""No."""
"Macaulay said: ""But what if you need more money?""
Wynant said: ""I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye."""
"Macaulay said: ""How are you?""
Nick said: ""Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.""
Macaulay said: ""Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....""
Nick said: ""That's all right.  What are you drinking?"""
"Macaulay said: ""Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?""
Nick said: ""Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?""
Macaulay said: ""She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.""
Nick said: ""I haven't been a detective for four years.""
Macaulay said: ""You don't say --""
Nick said: ""My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.""
Macaulay said: ""I see.  I see.""
Nick said: ""What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?""
Macaulay said: ""You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.""
Nick said: ""No word at all?""
Macaulay said: ""He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him."""
"Nick said: ""My wife.""
Macaulay said: ""How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,""
Nick said: ""S'long."""
"Nick said: ""How are you?""
Macaulay said: ""I hate to bother you when you're laid up.""
Nick said: ""That's all right."""
"Macaulay said: ""What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?""
Nick said: ""Slim."""
"Nick said: ""It might.""
Macaulay said: ""He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.""
Nick said: ""It wouldn't hurt to put it in."""
"Macaulay said: ""I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.""
Nick said: ""Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?""
Macaulay said: ""Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time."""
"Macaulay said: ""But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.""
Nick said: ""Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand."""
"Macaulay said: ""I have no right to answer that.""
Nick said: ""What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?"""
"Mimi said: ""Oh, Nick... Nick!""
Nick said: ""Hello, Mimi.""
Mimi said: ""want to talk to you about something very important."""
"Mimi said: ""Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.""
Nick said: ""What do you think?""
Mimi said: ""Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.""
Nick said: ""Well, don't you?""
Mimi said: ""You're always teasing."""
"Mimi said: ""Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?""
Nick said: ""Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.""
Mimi said: ""But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.""
Nick said: ""I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...""
Mimi said: ""Dorothy!  Is she here?""
Nick said: ""Yes..."""
"Mimi said: ""Where's Gilbert?""
Nick said: ""Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby."""
"Mimi said: ""Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --""
Nick said: ""You should have told them he'd disappeared."""
"Mimi said: ""But he has nothing to do with it!""
Nick said: ""That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?"""
"Mimi said: ""I tell you -- he didn't do it.""
Nick said: ""They'll want more than your word for that.""
Mimi said: ""All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!"""
"Mimi said: ""This is all very pleasant but why are here?""
Nick said: ""I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant."""
"Nick said: ""You did... where?""
Mimi said: ""Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.""
Nick said: ""Oh, did he?  What did he say?""
Mimi said: ""He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were."""
"Mimi said: ""Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.""
Nick said: ""So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop."""
"Mimi said: ""Perfectly absurd.""
Nick said: ""And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish."""
"Mimi said: ""Nobody told me.  I did see him!""
Nick said: ""What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?""
Mimi said: ""It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.""
Nick said: ""You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.""
Mimi said: ""I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -""
Nick said: ""Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?"""
"Morelli said: ""I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?""
Nick said: ""Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition."""
"Nick said: ""I've never heard about you.""
Morelli said: ""I didn't knock Julia off.""
Nick said: ""All right - you didn't.""
Morelli said: ""I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.""
Nick said: ""Why tell me?""
Morelli said: ""I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.""
Nick said: ""That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.""
Morelli said: ""Listen.  ""Studsy"" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....""
Nick said: ""How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.""
Morelli said: ""He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?""
Nick said: ""I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.""
Morelli said: ""That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.""
Nick said: ""I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd...."""
"Morelli said: ""What's that?""
Nick said: ""This is your party."""
"Nick said: ""Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?""
Morelli said: ""She don't say she is, but I figure she is -""
Nick said: ""Why do you say that?""
Morelli said: ""Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -""
Nick said: ""Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?"""
"Morelli said: ""What am I?  The fall guy?""
Nick said: ""I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?"""
"Nora said: ""So it's you he was after!""
Nick said: ""Hello, baby.""
Nora said: ""He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.""
Nick said: ""I had him out this morning.""
Nora said: ""I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --""
Nick said: ""Oh, this is Andy --"""
"Nora said: ""You might have mentioned me first.""
Nick said: ""He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.""
Nora said: ""As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --"""

Nick said: ""If you like 'em like that.""
Nora said: ""You got types?""
Nick said: ""Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.""
Nora said: ""Who is she?""
Nick said: ""I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.""
Nora said: ""By the way, how is your father's side?""
Nick said: ""Much better, thanks.""
Nora said: ""How many drinks have you had?""
Nick said: ""Six Martinis.""
Nora said: ""Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me."""
"Nora said: ""What hit me?""
Nick said: ""That last Martini."""
"Nora said: ""I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.""
Nick said: ""Take it easy."""
"Nora said: ""Who's that?""
Nick said: ""Santa Claus."""
"Nick said: ""Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.""
Nora said: ""We need ice."""
"Nora said: ""I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?""
Nick said: ""I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.""
Nora said: ""Room service, please -"""
"Nora said: ""Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --""
Nick said: ""I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it."""
"Nora said: ""Isn't that my drink?""
Nick said: ""What are you drinking?""
Nora said: ""Rye."""
"Nora said: ""Where did you get that?""
Nick said: ""She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.""
Nora said: ""What are you going to do with it?""
Nick said: ""Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her."""
"Nick said: ""She didn't tell me a thing.""
Nora said: ""Too bad you didn't bring your whip."""
"Nora said: ""Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?""
Nick said: ""Yes.""
Nora said: ""Good. I want to talk to you.""
Nick said: ""That's jolly.""
Nora said: ""Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?""
Nick said: ""Can't you get to sleep?""
Nora said: ""No.""
Nick said: ""Maybe a drink would help you.""
Nora said: ""No thanks.""
Nick said: ""Maybe it would if I took it."""
"Nora said: ""Everybody says you were a grand detective.""
Nick said: ""They were kidding you.""
Nora said: ""I'd like to see you work.""
Nick said: ""Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories."""
"Nora said: ""That poor girl is in a tough spot.""
Nick said: ""There's nothing I can do to help her."""
"Nora said: ""She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?""
Nick said: ""Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.""
Nora said: ""I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.""
Nick said: ""At breakfast."""
"Nora said: ""But it's Christmas now.""
Nick said: ""Breakfast.""
Nora said: ""What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.""
Nick said: ""You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back."""
"Nora said: ""Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,""
Nick said: ""That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep."""

Nick said: ""All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?"""
"Nick said: ""It's all right.  It just grazed me.""
Nora said: ""Someone get a doctor.""
Nick said: ""There's one coming.""
Nora said: ""Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?""
Nick said: ""Sure -- I don't even feel it.""
Nora said: ""I'll get some towels."""

Nora said: ""Want a drink?""
Nick said: ""Yeah."""

Nora said: ""You did.""
Nick said: ""You must admit I have good taste."""
"Nora said: ""Finished with these?""
Nick said: ""Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice."""
"Nora said: ""I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.""
Nick said: ""That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids."""
"Nick said: ""Hello... send him up.""
Nora said: ""Who's that?""
Nick said: ""Macaulay."""
"Nick said: ""Aren't you hot in that?""
Nora said: ""I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.""
Nick said: ""Is that another Christmas present?""
Nora said: ""Yes.""
Nick said: ""Did I give it to you?""
Nora said: ""Yes."""
"Nora said: ""Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  ""Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay"".""
Nick said: ""Let's see.  Where's it from?""
Nora said: ""Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?""
Nick said: ""I don't know.""
Nora said: ""He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.""
Nick said: ""Your guess is as good as mine.""
Nora said: ""Oh take it!  Please take it!"""
"Nick said: ""Oh, it's a fire hydrant.""
Nora said: ""Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present."""
"Nora said: ""Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!""
Nick said: ""It's not going to hurt me to get up.""
Nora said: ""Sit down!""
Nick said: ""You talk as if I were Asta.""
Nora said: ""All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs."""
"Nora said: ""What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.""
Nick said: ""What's the matter with you?""
Nora said: ""The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.""
Nick said: ""Maybe I will.""
Nora said: ""But Wynant --- ?""
Nick said: ""I don't believe he did it.""
Nora said: ""Why don't you?""
Nick said: ""No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.""
Nora said: ""So am I.""
Nick said: ""Come on, Watson, we're going places."""
"Nick said: ""This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.""
Nora said: ""Catch me letting you go alone!"""
"Nora said: ""I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?""
Nick said: ""I'm going to take Asta for a walk.""
Nora said: ""He's just been for a walk.""
Nick said: ""We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?"""
"Nora said: ""What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?""
Nick said: ""Looks like a hold-up!""
Nora said: ""What are you going to do?""
Nick said: ""I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.""
Nora said: ""Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.""
Nick said: ""He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.""
Nora said: ""You mean, he might be hiding there?""
Nick said: ""I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.""
Nora said: ""Nick - I won't have you going down there.""
Nick said: ""Say you're the one who got me in this!""
Nora said: ""I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.""
Nick said: ""I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.""
Nora said: ""Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.""
Nick said: ""You wouldn't be a widow long.""
Nora said: ""You bet I wouldn't.""
Nick said: ""Not with all your money!""
Nora said: ""You dog!""
Nick said: ""Goodbye, darling.""
Nora said: ""Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?""
Nick said: ""Sure I will.""
Nora said: ""Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.""
Nick said: ""Why, I believe the little woman cares.""
Nora said: ""I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!"""
"Nora said: ""Back to California""
Nick said: ""My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.""
Nora said: ""I want you to stay and find Wynant.""
Nick said: ""I did find him!""
Nora said: ""What do you mean?""
Nick said: ""He was down in the shop.""
Nora said: ""Nick!""
Nick said: ""It was his body that was buried there.""
Nora said: ""Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.""
Nick said: ""That's a fact.""
Nora said: ""Wynant's body?""
Nick said: ""Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?""
Nora said: ""But they all said it was Rosebreen's.""
Nick said: ""That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.""
Nora said: ""What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?""
Nick said: ""Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.""
Nora said: ""Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?""
Nick said: ""Huh?""
Nora said: ""What things made you so sure?""
Nick said: ""Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.""
Nora said: ""Well, don't they?""
Nick said: ""Sure."""
"Nora said: ""You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.""
Nick said: ""I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme."""
"Nora said: ""How long has he been dead?""
Nick said: ""Couple of months anyway.""
Nora said: ""Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.""
Nick said: ""Smart gal.""
Nora said: ""Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?""
Nick said: ""No.  Nobody but you."""
"Nora said: ""I'm going to tell her.""
Nick said: ""Hey... hey.  Don't do that.""
Nora said: ""But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...""
Nick said: ""I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.""
Nora said: ""Why not?""
Nick said: ""I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.""
Nora said: ""What are you going to do?""
Nick said: ""I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?""
Nora said: ""Yes!""
Nick said: ""Got a nice evening dress?""
Nora said: ""Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?""
Nick said: ""Got a nice evening dress?""
Nora said: ""I've got a lulu -- why?""
Nick said: ""I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.""
Nora said: ""The suspects!  They won't come.""
Nick said: ""Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.""
Nora said: ""Who do you think did it?""
Nick said: ""Mimi...""
Nora said: ""Mimi!""
Nick said: ""Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner....."""
"Nora said: ""You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.""
Nick said: ""Thank you, Mrs. Charles."""
"Nora said: ""I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?""
Nick said: ""Yes.""
Nora said: ""I wish you'd tell me who.""
Nick said: ""I wish you'd tell me."""
"Nora said: ""Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.""
Nick said: ""I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night."""
"Nora said: ""You're going to drive me crazy!""
Nick said: ""Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy."""
"Nora said: ""If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.""
Nick said: ""After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?"""
"Nora said: ""Is that true?""
Nick said: ""I don't know.""
Nora said: ""Why are you saying it?""
Nick said: ""It's the only way it makes sense.""
Nora said: ""I hope you're well.""
Nick said: ""His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off."""
"Nick said: ""Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?""
Tanner said: ""No, Mr. Charles.""
Nick said: ""How did you get in here?""
Tanner said: ""I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.""
Nick said: ""You worked here?""
Tanner said: ""Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.""
Nick said: ""Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?""
Tanner said: ""That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.""
Nick said: ""Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?""
Tanner said: ""Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.""
Nick said: ""Trying to put it off on her?""
Tanner said: ""Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -""
Nick said: ""You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.""
Tanner said: ""Police!"""
"Nick said: ""I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?""
Tanner said: ""No... no."""
"Tanner said: ""That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.""
Nick said: ""You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?"""
"Peppler said: ""Nick Charles here?""
Nora said: ""Yes.  Nick!""
Peppler said: ""You his wife?""
Nora said: ""Yes.""
Peppler said: ""He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!"""
"Nora said: ""Was he a good detective?""
Peppler said: ""I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right."""
"Tanner said: ""Well, congratulations.""
Wynant said: ""I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?""
Tanner said: ""Bonds, sir?""
Wynant said: ""I know I left them there.""
Tanner said: ""Maybe Miss Wolf has them.""
Wynant said: ""Maybe she has.""
Tanner said: ""You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.""
Wynant said: ""Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --"""
"Tom said: ""I'm sorry...  but...""
Wynant said: ""Two weeks work gone for nothing.""
Tom said: ""I just wanted to tell you...""
Wynant said: ""I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!"""
"Wynant said: ""Where are you going?""
Tom said: ""Home!""
Wynant said: ""Home?""
Tom said: ""I'm fired.""
Wynant said: ""Who fired you?""
Tom said: ""You did."""
"Epps said: ""You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?""
Driver said: ""Y-yes."""
"Epps said: ""Where were you going?""
Driver said: ""Baghdad.""
Epps said: ""What's in the other direction?""
Driver said: ""This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.""
Epps said: ""Turn the car around.""
Driver said: ""Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.""
Epps said: ""Nobody's going to hurt you."""
"Wes said: ""Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?""
Epps said: ""Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait."""
"Wes said: ""...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.""
Epps said: ""You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat."""
"Epps said: ""Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.""
Wes said: ""I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school."""
"Wes said: ""Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.""
Epps said: ""Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is."""
"Wes said: ""Paper.""
Epps said: ""It's a fortune box."""
"Wes said: ""What's it say?""
Epps said: ""Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory."""
"Wes said: ""It's a map, I think that's what it is.""
Epps said: ""There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire."""
"Epps said: ""A casual one.""
Wes said: ""Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.""
Epps said: ""Better grab up some sand to take home to your family."""
"Wes said: ""You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?""
Epps said: ""I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say."""
"Epps said: ""Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.""
Wes said: ""Oh, God."""
"Wes said: ""What?""
Epps said: ""I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.""
Wes said: ""I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine."""
"Epps said: ""Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.""
Wes said: ""No, please, not again."""
"Wes said: ""What are we going to do!?""
Epps said: ""We're going to keep driving."""
"Wes said: ""They stopped.""
Epps said: ""Wha...""
Wes said: ""Oh, Jesus, they've stopped."""
"Epps said: ""They shouldn't have been here.""
Wes said: ""We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!""
Epps said: ""This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.""
Wes said: ""Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.""
Epps said: ""They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying."""
"Wes said: ""What are you doing.""
Epps said: ""Low on gas.  Got to refill."""
"Epps said: ""You two fighting's not going to get us anything.""
Wes said: ""Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either."""
"Epps said: ""Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.""
Wes said: ""Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.""
Epps said: ""He's not so--""
Wes said: ""He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.""
Epps said: ""How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet."""
"Wes said: ""What kind of mine?""
Epps said: ""I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.""
Wes said: ""Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.""
Epps said: ""Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces."""
"Epps said: ""We've got rope?""
Wes said: ""For climbing.""
Epps said: ""Break it out."""
"Wes said: ""What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.""
Epps said: ""You just go when I say go.""
Wes said: ""Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing."""
"Epps said: ""Ready?""
Wes said: ""Yeah."""
"Epps said: ""All right.  Let's get out of here.""
Wes said: ""The soldiers are going to kill those people!"""
"Epps said: ""There's nothing we can do.""
Wes said: ""We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds."""
"Epps said: ""I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.""
Wes said: ""We can't just go off and--""
Epps said: ""There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place."""
"Epps said: ""All we've got to do is make it to the top.""
Wes said: ""And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.""
Epps said: ""We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing."""
"Epps said: ""Not much of a pass.""
Wes said: ""Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.""
Epps said: ""Picks up again just on the other side."""
"Wes said: ""The US Army:  Always an adventure.""
Epps said: ""Let me see the map."""
"Epps said: ""Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.""
Wes said: ""What do you figure it to be?""
Epps said: ""Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive."""
"Wes said: ""Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.""
Epps said: ""Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--"""
"Wes said: ""Where'd they go?""
Epps said: ""I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--""
Wes said: ""Weird they didn't chase us."""
"Wes said: ""And they can't fly around out there forever.""
Epps said: ""So we wait."""
"Wes said: ""Missile!""
Epps said: ""Move!"""
"Epps said: ""All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.""
Wes said: ""What am I supposed to do?""
Epps said: ""Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either."""
"Wes said: ""Epps!""
Epps said: ""I heard!"""
"Epps said: ""I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.""
Wes said: ""Ready when you are."""
"Wes said: ""You ready?""
Epps said: ""All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--"""
"Epps said: ""It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.""
Wes said: ""What about the gold?""
Epps said: ""What about it?""
Wes said: ""Maybe we should split it up now.""
Epps said: ""We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.""
Wes said: ""What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share."""
"Wes said: ""You're the one with all the ideas.""
Epps said: ""You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.""
Wes said: ""Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.""
Epps said: ""Maybe I do.""
Wes said: ""Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own."""
"Wes said: ""You got no reason to do that!""
Epps said: ""I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?"""
"Wes said: ""You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.""
Epps said: ""Then get up and do something about it."""
"Epps said: ""Get off him.""
Wes said: ""He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.""
Epps said: ""Get off him!"""
"Epps said: ""What happened?""
Wes said: ""I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us."""
"Epps said: ""Stop it!""
Wes said: ""I told you; don't push me around."""
"Wes said: ""Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.""
Epps said: ""Why'd he come in our camp."""
"Wes said: ""Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.""
Epps said: ""How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.""
Wes said: ""He...he could have been watching us."""
"Wes said: ""I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.""
Epps said: ""Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out."""
"Wes said: ""We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...""
Epps said: ""You said he was a deserter.""
Wes said: ""That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.""
Epps said: ""You don't know that.""
Wes said: ""You don't know he isn't."""
"Epps said: ""You're out of your mind.""
Wes said: ""He's an enemy soldier.""
Epps said: ""I'm not going to let you kill him.""
Wes said: ""We're at war."""
"Epps said: ""We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--""
Wes said: ""He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need."""
"Wes said: ""I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.""
Epps said: ""I've got no stomach for murder.""
Wes said: ""It's a combat action.""
Epps said: ""It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.""
Wes said: ""Then step aside.""
Epps said: ""No.""
Wes said: ""Get out of my way."""
"Wes said: ""You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.""
Epps said: ""I out rank you, that's why.""
Wes said: ""In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around."""
"Epps said: ""We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...""
Wes said: ""What if I do?"""
"Wes said: ""No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.""
Epps said: ""Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.""
Wes said: ""Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.""
Epps said: ""And let me guess who is."""
"Wes said: ""I'm the one's got the big stick.""
Epps said: ""Suppose I don't go for that?""
Wes said: ""Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.""
Epps said: ""What about Jaeger?""
Wes said: ""Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you."""
"Wes said: ""In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.""
Epps said: ""We thought--"""
"Epps said: ""Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.""
Wes said: ""Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.""
Epps said: ""Wes--""
Wes said: ""Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?"""
"Wes said: ""Thanks for taking care of this for me.""
Epps said: ""Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy."""
"Wes said: ""You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.""
Epps said: ""That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.""
Wes said: ""That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--"""

Epps said: ""You don't know John Epps very well, do you?"""
"Epps said: ""Just keep quiet.""
Wes said: ""I have to answer him.""
Epps said: ""So you can give us away?""
Wes said: ""If I don't answer, he'll know something's up."""

Epps said: ""If I give it to you, will you let us go?"""

Jaeger said: ""I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.""
Epps said: ""No you're not."""
"Epps said: ""You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.""
Jaeger said: ""Blow me.""
Epps said: ""Another month in this desert and I might just."""
"Epps said: ""Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.""
Jaeger said: ""Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me."""
"Epps said: ""Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.""
Jaeger said: ""There might be something in there.""
Epps said: ""Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.""
Jaeger said: ""There might be."""
"Jaeger said: ""This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?""
Epps said: ""Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?""
Jaeger said: ""I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place."""
"Epps said: ""You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.""
Jaeger said: ""OH MY GOD!"""
"Epps said: ""What!?  What!?""
Jaeger said: ""I did it!  I got the box open."""
"Jaeger said: ""You think?""
Epps said: ""Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect."""
"Jaeger said: ""They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.""
Epps said: ""Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.""
Jaeger said: ""I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt."""
"Epps said: ""Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.""
Jaeger said: ""Wait.  Wait."""
"Epps said: ""I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.""
Jaeger said: ""Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.""
Epps said: ""Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?""
Jaeger said: ""Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff."""
"Epps said: ""And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.""
Jaeger said: ""What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers."""
"Epps said: ""It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--""
Jaeger said: ""We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.""
Epps said: ""But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing."""
"Epps said: ""It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.""
Jaeger said: ""We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy."""
"Epps said: ""Now this is war.""
Jaeger said: ""Roger that."""
"Jaeger said: ""You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?""
Epps said: ""Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?"""
"Epps said: ""But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.""
Jaeger said: ""You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?"""
"Epps said: ""Third.  What you're going to do with your third.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.""
Epps said: ""A car?  You're going to buy a car?"""
"Epps said: ""You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?""
Jaeger said: ""What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?""
Epps said: ""Invest it.""
Jaeger said: ""Oh, that's fun.""
Epps said: ""It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.""
Jaeger said: ""And I'm talking about enjoying myself.""
Epps said: ""You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--"""
"Epps said: ""Take the binoculars.""
Jaeger said: ""Wh-what do you think--""
Epps said: ""TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!"""
"Epps said: ""Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!""
Jaeger said: ""We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.""
Epps said: ""We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase."""
"Jaeger said: ""They'll shoot us!""
Epps said: ""We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.""
Jaeger said: ""They're not going to--""
Epps said: ""It's the only way.  We drive!"""
"Epps said: ""Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.""
Jaeger said: ""Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool."""
"Jaeger said: ""Steady it out!""
Epps said: ""I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!"""
"Epps said: ""She okay?""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.""
Epps said: ""Let's go."""
"Epps said: ""What?""
Jaeger said: ""I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.""
Epps said: ""You can't tell anybody about this.""
Jaeger said: ""I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!"""
"Epps said: ""It'd make their heads explode.""
Jaeger said: ""Millionaires, man."""
"Epps said: ""Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.""
Jaeger said: ""...I know.""
Epps said: ""And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?""
Jaeger said: ""I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back."""
"Epps said: ""What do we do with the Humvee?""
Jaeger said: ""We leave it."""
"Epps said: ""SAY IT!""
Jaeger said: ""I got that...sir."""
"Jaeger said: ""Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.""
Epps said: ""Faster we get there, faster we get back.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you."""
"Jaeger said: ""I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.""
Epps said: ""Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.""
Jaeger said: ""I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip."""
"Epps said: ""What!?""
Jaeger said: ""Mine."""
"Epps said: ""What?""
Jaeger said: ""Mine.  Land mine!"""
"Epps said: ""You didn't step on any mine.""
Jaeger said: ""I heard it click.""
Epps said: ""If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.""
Jaeger said: ""I heard it."""
"Jaeger said: ""Oh, God!  Oh God!""
Epps said: ""Just be cool.""
Jaeger said: ""It's a mine, isn't it?""
Epps said: ""Just relax.""
Jaeger said: ""How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?""
Epps said: ""We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool."""
"Jaeger said: ""Where you going?""
Epps said: ""Me and Wes are just going to talk.""
Jaeger said: ""Why you got to move away to talk!?""
Epps said: ""We're going to be right over here.""
Jaeger said: ""You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!""
Epps said: ""I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!"""
"Epps said: ""There's a way.""
Jaeger said: ""Epps..."""
"Epps said: ""I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.""
Jaeger said: ""Epps, my leg is falling asleep."""
"Jaeger said: ""My leg is falling asleep.""
Epps said: ""It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.""
Jaeger said: ""I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.""
Epps said: ""It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up."""
"Jaeger said: ""How's this going to work?""
Epps said: ""Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.""
Jaeger said: ""That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay."""
"Epps said: ""You're going to be fine.""
Jaeger said: ""You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!"""
"Epps said: ""When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.""
Jaeger said: ""Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die."""
"Jaeger said: ""You're going to blow yourselves up.""
Epps said: ""Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.""
Jaeger said: ""You don't know that.  It could be a trick.""
Epps said: ""If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps."""
"Epps said: ""This.  Whatever it is.""
Jaeger said: ""It's the treasure, that's what it is."""
"Epps said: ""You're not losing trust, are you?""
Jaeger said: ""Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it."""
"Epps said: ""I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal."""
"Jaeger said: ""I don't hear any--""
Epps said: ""Shut up and listen!"""
"Epps said: ""Don't!""
Jaeger said: ""It's a fire fight.""
Epps said: ""Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on."""
"Epps said: ""Iraqis.  A bunch of them.""
Jaeger said: ""What are they doing here?"""
"Epps said: ""Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.""
Jaeger said: ""What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?"""
"Epps said: ""They're doing more than slapping.""
Jaeger said: ""The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that."""
"Epps said: ""Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.""
Jaeger said: ""So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go."""
"Jaeger said: ""X marks the spot.""
Epps said: ""Something like that.""
Jaeger said: ""But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.""
Epps said: ""I hope it means something, otherwise..."""
"Jaeger said: ""Where is it?  Where'd it go?""
Epps said: ""Stay low.""
Jaeger said: ""Where the hell is it!?""
Epps said: ""Just stay down."""
"Jaeger said: ""What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?""
Epps said: ""We're not going to do anything.""
Jaeger said: ""They're going to kill us!""
Epps said: ""They can't shoot us in here."""
"Jaeger said: ""If they land--""
Epps said: ""If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about."""
"Jaeger said: ""Think there might be more Iraqis?""
Epps said: ""Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns."""
"Epps said: ""A whole lot of nothing.""
Jaeger said: ""So where do we start?"""
"Epps said: ""What are you doing?""
Jaeger said: ""What does it look like I'm doing?""
Epps said: ""It looks like you're not doing anything.""
Jaeger said: ""I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.""
Epps said: ""Get up and dig.""
Jaeger said: ""We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.""
Epps said: ""Get up off your ass and dig!"""
"Jaeger said: ""Must be a compartment.""
Epps said: ""I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon."""
"Jaeger said: ""Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.""
Epps said: ""It's giving."""
"Epps said: ""It's just a mongoose.""
Jaeger said: ""Is it dead?""
Epps said: ""Yeah, Bwana, you got it."""
"Jaeger said: ""It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.""
Epps said: ""I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.""
Jaeger said: ""You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you."""
"Jaeger said: ""Wait.""
Epps said: ""What?"""
"Epps said: ""What?""
Jaeger said: ""We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?""
Epps said: ""He's not going to leave us.""
Jaeger said: ""What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line..."""
"Jaeger said: ""Why do I have to stay down here?""
Epps said: ""Jesus, Jaeger.""
Jaeger said: ""I don't see how that plan's any better.""
Epps said: ""Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself."""
"Epps said: ""All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work."""
"Epps said: ""What the hell took so long.""
Jaeger said: ""Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.""
Epps said: ""Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not."""
"Jaeger said: ""Wes might be right about that.""
Epps said: ""It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas."""
"Epps said: ""We should head Northeast.""
Jaeger said: ""Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.""
Epps said: ""There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.""
Jaeger said: ""It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.""
Epps said: ""You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast."""
"Jaeger said: ""What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?""
Epps said: ""We'll find our way.""
Jaeger said: ""How!?""
Epps said: ""We'll find our way!  We'll..."""
"Epps said: ""We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.""
Jaeger said: ""Forget Wes.""
Epps said: ""We can't just leave him.""
Jaeger said: ""Wes is dead!""
Epps said: ""What if he's not?""
Jaeger said: ""Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass."""
"Jaeger said: ""No.""
Epps said: ""We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror."""
"Jaeger said: ""No.""
Epps said: ""What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.""
Jaeger said: ""They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.""
Epps said: ""We'll lie.""
Jaeger said: ""They'll search the pack."""
"Epps said: ""First Wes, now you?""
Jaeger said: ""I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.""
Epps said: ""And you; you've got it all together.""
Jaeger said: ""I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.""
Epps said: ""That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death."""
"Jaeger said: ""I'm sorry about that, Epps.""
Epps said: ""Is it all right if I stand up?"""
"Jaeger said: ""I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.""
Epps said: ""Yeah.  Well, me too.""
Jaeger said: ""I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.""
Epps said: ""Sure.""
Jaeger said: ""Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.""
Epps said: ""You still got a map on you?""
Jaeger said: ""What?  Yeah."""
"Jaeger said: ""Epps?""
Epps said: ""Yeah.""
Jaeger said: ""I don't want to die.""
Epps said: ""Makes two of us.""
Jaeger said: ""I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.""
Epps said: ""It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.""
Jaeger said: ""I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--"""
"Jaeger said: ""Sorry.""
Epps said: ""Damn."""
"Jaeger said: ""What do you think our chances are?""
Epps said: ""If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise."""
"Jaeger said: ""Wonder how the war's going?""
Epps said: ""It's got to be going better than this.."""
"Epps said: ""We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.""
Jaeger said: ""You sure you want me too?"""
"Jaeger said: ""I pick that way.""
Epps said: ""Okay.  Then we go this way."""
"Jaeger said: ""Getting cold.""
Epps said: ""It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.""
Jaeger said: ""Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.""
Epps said: ""No!""
Jaeger said: ""Just let me rest for a second.""
Epps said: ""We've got to keep moving while there's still light.""
Jaeger said: ""You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.""
Epps said: ""Don't you touch it.""
Jaeger said: ""I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.""
Epps said: ""The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal."""
"Jaeger said: ""What do you figure it is?""
Epps said: ""Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.""
Jaeger said: ""Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?""
Epps said: ""Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on."""
"Epps said: ""We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.""
Jaeger said: ""Epps.  What if they're not Saudi."""
"Jaeger said: ""Well?""
Epps said: ""Well, we should identify ourselves.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah, I guess we should."""
"Epps said: ""Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.""
Jaeger said: ""Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably."""
"Epps said: ""That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.""
Jaeger said: ""Probably."""
"Epps said: ""What did you say?""
Jaeger said: ""I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means ""Don't shoot. We're your friends.""""
Epps said: ""They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!"""
"Jaeger said: ""Oh, God...""
Epps said: ""They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.""
Jaeger said: ""What are we going to do?"""
"Epps said: ""Slip out your M-16.""
Jaeger said: ""And then what?""
Epps said: ""And then shoot them.""
Jaeger said: ""I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.""
Epps said: ""Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down."""
"Jaeger said: ""Can't you--""
Epps said: ""I don't have a weapon."""
"Epps said: ""Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!""
Jaeger said: ""I just said I would.  I don't think I--""
Epps said: ""Shoot them!"""
"Epps said: ""An Iraqi?""
Jaeger said: ""I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes."""
"Jaeger said: ""What do we do?""
Epps said: ""We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot."""
"Jaeger said: ""To where?""
Epps said: ""Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia."""
"Jaeger said: ""What do we do?""
Epps said: ""We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us."""
"Jaeger said: ""What do you make of them?""
Epps said: ""Shi'ites, I think.""
Jaeger said: ""Is that good, or bad?""
Epps said: ""I don't know.  They killed Wes.""
Jaeger said: ""Why haven't they killed us!?""
Epps said: ""I don't know!""
Jaeger said: ""...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.""
Epps said: ""With what?  Against how many?""
Jaeger said: ""We can't just sit here waiting to die.""
Epps said: ""You come up with a better plan, let me know.""
Jaeger said: ""Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us."""
"Epps said: ""...Wes...?""
Jaeger said: ""You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!"""
"Jaeger said: ""I didn't say that.  I never said--""
Epps said: ""Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid."""
"Jaeger said: ""Can you ride a horse?""
Epps said: ""No, but I figure now's a real good time to start."""
"Jaeger said: ""Which way do we go!?""
Epps said: ""We go this way."""
"Epps said: ""Damn it.  We lost the horses.""
Jaeger said: ""The...the gold...""
Epps said: ""It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.""
Jaeger said: ""When did you make the switch?""
Epps said: ""It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.""
Jaeger said: ""But...""
Epps said: ""We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.""
Jaeger said: ""What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...""
Epps said: ""You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy."""
"Jaeger said: ""Well?""
Epps said: ""A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.""
Jaeger said: ""How do we do that?""
Epps said: ""You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.""
Jaeger said: ""Why do I have to lie in the road?""
Epps said: ""Somebody has to.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?""
Epps said: ""Then I'm a rich man."""
"Jaeger said: ""Epps.""
Epps said: ""Yeah.""
Jaeger said: ""I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.""
Epps said: ""Thanks.""
Jaeger said: ""This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...""
Epps said: ""Threatened to blow my brains out?""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.""
Epps said: ""Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier."""
"Jaeger said: ""Epps?""
Epps said: ""What?""
Jaeger said: ""I'm thinking about taking a trip.""
Epps said: ""Thought you were going to buy a car.""
Jaeger said: ""Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?""
Epps said: ""I don't know.""
Jaeger said: ""I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?""
Epps said: ""How the hell should I know?"""
"Epps said: ""Australia.""
Jaeger said: ""What?""
Epps said: ""I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.""
Jaeger said: ""Really?""
Epps said: ""That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold."""
"Jaeger said: ""Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.""
Epps said: ""We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold."""
"Jaeger said: ""Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.""
Epps said: ""He'll slow down."""
"Jaeger said: ""He's not slowing.""
Epps said: ""He's going to slow down."""
"Jaeger said: ""Woods.""
Woods said: ""Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.""
Jaeger said: ""I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.""
Woods said: ""A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?"""
"Woods said: ""That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.""
Jaeger said: ""I could use some recon photos too."""
"Woods said: ""Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?""
Jaeger said: ""Just...want to be ready when we do.""

Jaeger said: ""The photos."""
"Jaeger said: ""Some good ones.""
Woods said: ""They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.""
Jaeger said: ""Saddam's got a boil on his ass?"""
"Wes said: ""Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.""
Jaeger said: ""A headache?""
Wes said: ""Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.""
Jaeger said: ""I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.""
Wes said: ""Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.""
Jaeger said: ""Okay."""
"Jaeger said: ""We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.""
Wes said: ""I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.""
Jaeger said: ""People are suffering.""
Wes said: ""People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything."""
"Jaeger said: ""When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?""
Wes said: ""I'm saying don't do it accidently.""
Jaeger said: ""Oh yeah.  Accidently."""
"Wes said: ""Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.""
Jaeger said: ""It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.""
Wes said: ""I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia."""
"Jaeger said: ""Spanish wasn't hard enough?""
Wes said: ""I thought it would be good to know."""
"Jaeger said: ""What does that mean?""
Wes said: ""Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.""
Jaeger said: ""How do you say ""Come here, baby.  I'm horny.""  I can use that now.""
Wes said: ""Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble."""
"Jaeger said: ""What is this?""
Wes said: ""Now you need me.""
Jaeger said: ""What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is."""
"Wes said: ""He says it's a box.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah, you're funny.""
Wes said: ""It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.""
Jaeger said: ""For real?  A treasure?"""
"Wes said: ""And you're the guy who's going to open it.""
Jaeger said: ""I could."""
"Wes said: ""You get it yet?""
Jaeger said: ""Naw, nothing.""
Wes said: ""You will.  You'll get it.""
Jaeger said: ""I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.""
Wes said: ""You really think there's a treasure inside?""
Jaeger said: ""I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing."""
"Wes said: ""Jaeger?""
Jaeger said: ""What?""
Wes said: ""You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah.  So?""
Wes said: ""That's in two days.""
Jaeger said: ""Like I said; so?""
Wes said: ""They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--""
Jaeger said: ""What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?""
Wes said: ""We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.""
Jaeger said: ""It doesn't mean anything.""
Wes said: ""Why would they do all that if we weren't?"""
"Wes said: ""Jaeger?""
Jaeger said: ""What!?""
Wes said: ""You ever think about dying?""
Jaeger said: ""Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.""
Wes said: ""You ever think about it?  You ever worry?""
Jaeger said: ""The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find."""
"Jaeger said: ""At-at-at-at-at.""
Wes said: ""This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.""
Jaeger said: ""At-at-at-at-at."""
"Wes said: ""The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.""
Jaeger said: ""You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war."""
"Jaeger said: ""It's...it's...I don't know what it is.""
Wes said: ""It's a container.  Break the seal."""
"Jaeger said: ""That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.""
Wes said: ""Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?"""
"Jaeger said: ""We...we could go home with something else.""
Wes said: ""What?""
Jaeger said: ""With...with millions.  Millions of dollars."""
"Wes said: ""You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.""
Jaeger said: ""It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--""
Wes said: ""You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--""
Jaeger said: ""It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--""
Wes said: ""It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.""
Jaeger said: ""It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.""
Wes said: ""So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps."""
"Wes said: ""Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.""
Jaeger said: ""You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.""
Wes said: ""You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive."""
"Wes said: ""God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.""
Jaeger said: ""Yes!"""
"Wes said: ""We're going to get court martialed, you know that.""
Jaeger said: ""Hell, we'll just buy our way out."""
"Jaeger said: ""Epps, is that a sand dune.""
Wes said: ""Oh, no."""
"Jaeger said: ""Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?""
Wes said: ""If!  If there's a treasure.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?""
Wes said: ""I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah!  Gold!  How much?""
Wes said: ""How the hell should I know how much?"""
"Wes said: ""If there's gold.  If!""
Jaeger said: ""You know what I'm doing with my half?"""
"Wes said: ""This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.""
Jaeger said: ""A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--"""
"Jaeger said: ""Iraqis.""
Wes said: ""Oh, God!""
Jaeger said: ""Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.""
Wes said: ""Oh, Jesus!""
Jaeger said: ""They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!"""
"Jaeger said: ""Yeah!  Yeah!""
Wes said: ""I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.""
Jaeger said: ""You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it."""
"Wes said: ""I thought we were dead.""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah, well, we're not.""
Wes said: ""We got to get out of here."""
"Wes said: ""We have to go back.""
Jaeger said: ""We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.""
Wes said: ""We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?"""
"Wes said: ""So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?""
Jaeger said: ""...I figured...I figured you'd turn back."""
"Jaeger said: ""We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.""
Wes said: ""Then lets go back while we still can.""
Jaeger said: ""As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it."""
"Wes said: ""You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.""
Jaeger said: ""You have to go with us, Wes.""
Wes said: ""Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?""
Jaeger said: ""You have to go with us.  You can't walk back..."""
"Jaeger said: ""Epps...""
Wes said: ""Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway."""
"Wes said: ""How long we going to keep this up.""
Jaeger said: ""Until we're out of the mine field is how long.""
Wes said: ""Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.""
Jaeger said: ""That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.""
Wes said: ""You want to crawl, crawl."""
"Wes said: ""If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.""
Jaeger said: ""Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you."""
"Wes said: ""I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.""
Jaeger said: ""Anytime you want to do something about it just let--"""
"Jaeger said: ""Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?""
Wes said: ""Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some."""
"Wes said: ""Is there anything you do know?""
Jaeger said: ""I know you're a pussy.  I know that."""
"Jaeger said: ""So?""
Wes said: ""We have to do something."""
"Wes said: ""We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.""
Jaeger said: ""Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.""
Wes said: ""You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.""
Jaeger said: ""I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all."""
"Jaeger said: ""Think we can make it?""
Wes said: ""We make it, or we go back empty handed."""
"Jaeger said: ""Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.""
Wes said: ""Just seems weird they didn't chase us."""
"Wes said: ""What do you think?""
Jaeger said: ""Lines up with the map and the photos."""
"Wes said: ""It's got a bottom.""
Jaeger said: ""Guess we know what the next stop is."""
"Wes said: ""You down?""
Jaeger said: ""Yeah, we're down.""
Wes said: ""What do you see?"""
"Wes said: ""What the hell are you doing!?""
Jaeger said: ""I think we found something."""
"Jaeger said: ""With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.""
Wes said: ""He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands."""
"Wes said: ""Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.""
Jaeger said: ""He lived through that?"""
"Jaeger said: ""Maybe we should give him some water.""
Wes said: ""All last night he could have been--""
Jaeger said: ""I think he wants something to drink.""
Wes said: ""I'm not wasting my water on him."""
"Jaeger said: ""So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.""
Wes said: ""He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out."""
"Jaeger said: ""Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.""
Wes said: ""You want to say some words?"""
"Jaeger said: ""You're going to burn up in those.""
Wes said: ""The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them."""
"Jaeger said: ""Think the Iraqi's killed them all?""
Wes said: ""Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers."""
"Wes said: ""When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?""
Jaeger said: ""We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.""

"Bev said: ""Hey, that's the guy-""
Reilly said: ""We just got a bomb threat upstairs."""
"Reilly said: ""How's the print coming?""
Bev said: ""One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.""
Reilly said: ""Damn."""

Reilly said: ""You the Bomb Squad?"""
"Glass said: ""Where did you get this?""
Reilly said: ""Off a girl's wrist. A suspect..."""

Reilly said: ""What do you mean?"""
"Glass said: ""Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.""
Reilly said: ""Thanks."""
"Glass said: ""Alright, let's check it out.""
Reilly said: ""We can start in the area where the robbery occurred."""
"Reilly said: ""What're you talking about?""
Glass said: ""When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.""
Reilly said: ""We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?"""
"Reilly said: ""What was-? Why...?""
Glass said: ""That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner."""
"Reilly said: ""What?""
Glass said: ""This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?""
Reilly said: ""Now wait just a fucking-""
Glass said: ""Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive."""
"Glass said: ""By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.""
Reilly said: ""Mike Reilly."""
"Glass said: ""We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.""
Reilly said: ""So you're the ""Device Squad""... and you defuse ""devices""?""
Glass said: ""Treat. We treat devices.""
Reilly said: ""Anything else I should know?""
Glass said: ""Don't push it, slick."""
"Glass said: ""I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?""
Reilly said: ""She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?""
Glass said: ""Only once, at Redstone.""
Reilly said: ""Where...?"""
"Glass said: ""Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?""
Reilly said: ""Hey, look--""
Glass said: ""No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us ""punks"" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.""
Reilly said: ""Oh yeah? Prove it.""
Glass said: ""Drive."""
"Reilly said: ""The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.""
Glass said: ""Then let's go see what they missed."""
"Glass said: ""So what were they doing here?""
Reilly said: ""I don't know. You tell me?""
Glass said: ""An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.""
Reilly said: ""You mentioned something called Redstone.""
Glass said: ""Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.""
Reilly said: ""Cream of the crop, huh? You?""
Glass said: ""Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.""
Reilly said: ""Sounds like terrorist heaven.""
Glass said: ""There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.""
Reilly said: ""Just how easy is it to build a... device?""
Glass said: ""With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?"""
"Glass said: ""Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.""
Reilly said: ""Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.""
Glass said: ""No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage."""
"Glass said: ""This is where the van was parked.""
Reilly said: ""Yep.""
Glass said: ""Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...""
Reilly said: ""Look, it's a longshot...""
Glass said: ""Bingo!"""
"Reilly said: ""Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?""
Glass said: ""Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ..."""
"Glass said: ""How long are we going to stay?""
Reilly said: ""`Til we get a better lead."""
"Glass said: ""Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?""
Reilly said: ""What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.""
Glass said: ""Right.""
Reilly said: ""Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago."""
"Reilly said: ""You guys seem pretty tight.""
Glass said: ""We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.""
Reilly said: ""Why do you do it?""
Glass said: ""I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things..."""
"Reilly said: ""So cut both.""
Glass said: ""One shuts it down, one turns arms it.""
Reilly said: ""Which one's which?""
Glass said: ""I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire."""
"Glass said: ""How long were you hooked?""
Reilly said: ""What?""
Glass said: ""You don't have to talk about it."""
"Reilly said: ""Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.""
Glass said: ""Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.""
Reilly said: ""I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.""
Glass said: ""Your partner?""
Reilly said: ""I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since."""
"Reilly said: ""I terrible with mechanical things.""

Reilly said: ""Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.""
Glass said: ""Should we head for the Interstate?""
Reilly said: ""Would you?""
Glass said: ""No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...""
Reilly said: ""Me, too."""

Glass said: ""Off the scale.""
Reilly said: ""What do we do?"""
"Reilly said: ""Talk to me. Let's assess.""
Glass said: ""Right."""
"Reilly said: ""C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!""
Glass said: ""He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor."""
"Glass said: ""Good, now the other side.""
Reilly said: ""Nothing.""
Glass said: ""Okay, let's go in."""
"Reilly said: ""Keep talking.""
Glass said: ""Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel."""

Glass said: ""That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...""
Reilly said: ""What's wrong?""
Glass said: ""Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.""
Reilly said: ""Make up your mind, trigger."""

François said: ""About tonsils.""

Mariette said: ""Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--""
Gaston said: ""Mariette!""
Mariette said: ""Yes, Gaston?""
Gaston said: ""You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.""
Mariette said: ""<u>Adolph</u>?""
Gaston said: ""Adolph J. Giron.""
Mariette said: ""And you expect me to believe that?""
Gaston said: ""Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it."""
"Gaston said: ""Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.""
Mariette said: ""I don't believe it!""
Gaston said: ""Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?"""
"Gaston said: ""It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?""
Mariette said: ""Giron...!""
Gaston said: ""Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, ""Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!"""""
"Gaston said: ""Goodbye...""
Mariette said: ""Goodbye.""
Gaston said: ""It could have been marvelous ...""
Mariette said: ""Divine ...""
Gaston said: ""Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.""
Mariette said: ""But it could have been glorious.""
Gaston said: ""Lovely.""
Mariette said: ""Divine ... But that terrible policeman!""
Gaston said: ""Goodbye ..."""
"Mariette'S Voice said: ""Oh, M'sieu Laval ...""
Gaston'S Voice said: ""Yes, Madame Colet?""
Mariette'S Voice said: ""Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?""
Gaston'S Voice said: ""Yes--uh--""
Mariette'S Voice said: ""Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.""
Gaston'S Voice said: ""What is it, madame?""
Mariette'S Voice said: ""I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight."""
"Mariette'S Voice said: ""Oh, no, it's the way you lead.""
Gaston'S Voice said: ""No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.""
Mariette'S Voice said: ""No, m'sieu!""
Gaston'S Voice said: ""Yes, madame!""
Mariette'S Voice said: ""Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock."""
"Mariette said: ""But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?""
Giron said: ""I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to--""
Mariette said: ""To M'sieu Laval?"""
"Giron said: ""Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...""
Mariette said: ""I know!""
Giron said: ""Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?""
Mariette said: ""He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.""
Giron said: ""You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?""
Mariette said: ""Jacques!"""
"Mariette said: ""You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.""
Lily said: ""Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.""
Mariette said: ""Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die."""
"Lily said: ""Two lumps, madame?""
Mariette said: ""Please!  Thank you.""
Lily said: ""May I?"""
"Lily said: ""Yes, madame?""
Mariette said: ""You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!""
Lily said: ""About what?""
Mariette said: ""Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.""
Lily said: ""Naturally not!"""
"Mariette said: ""Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?""
Lily said: ""Well--uh--yes and no.""
Mariette said: ""To me he seems rather nervous.""
Lily said: ""Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!""
Mariette said: ""No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--""
Lily said: ""So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--""
Mariette said: ""Yes! And he would have a little more time for--""
Lily said: ""For all the really important things--""
Mariette said: ""Right!""
Lily said: ""I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.""
Mariette said: ""Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!""
Lily said: ""Very well, madame. Thank you."""
"Lily said: ""Yes, madame?""
Mariette said: ""How much is your salary?"""
"Mariette said: ""Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?""
Lily said: ""Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!"""
"Mariette said: ""I think you'd better go.""
Lily said: ""Ever had a romance with a crook?""
Mariette said: ""I beg your pardon!""
Lily said: ""Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...""
Mariette said: ""Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--""
Lily said: ""I don't want your money!"""
"Mariette said: ""You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.""
Major said: ""He started it.""
Mariette said: ""But you're the more intelligent one.""
Major said: ""That's true.""
Mariette said: ""Then why did you do it?""
Major said: ""Because I hate him--because I love you!""
Mariette said: ""You should have more self-control. You were in the army.""
Major said: ""Well, he was in the navy."""
"Major said: ""Your bag?""
Mariette said: ""Yes, my bag!""
Major said: ""Didn't you take it with you?""
Mariette said: ""Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?""

"Andrews said: ""Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.""
Smith said: ""That's right.""
Andrews said: ""Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.""
Smith said: ""The pumps --""
Andrews said: ""The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder."""

Andrews said: ""An hour, two at most."""

Andrews said: ""Thank you, Rose."""
"Rose said: ""Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.""
Andrews said: ""About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled."""

Andrews said: ""The ship will sink.""
Rose said: ""You're certain?""
Andrews said: ""Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic."""
"Andrews said: ""Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?""
Rose said: ""Yes, I understand. Thank you."""
"Rose said: ""Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!""
Andrews said: ""What? You have to get to a boat right away!""
Rose said: ""No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.""
Andrews said: ""Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.""
Rose said: ""Bottom, left, right. I have it.""
Andrews said: ""Hurry, Rose."""
"Rose said: ""Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?""

Ruth said: ""Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.""

Rose said: ""I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them.

Jack said: ""I'm sorry. Really... I am.""
Rose said: ""Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit..."""
"Rose said: ""So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?""
Jack said: ""Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.""
Rose said: ""A whole ten cents?!""
Jack said: ""Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.""
Rose said: ""Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.""
Jack said: ""Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.""
Rose said: ""You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?""
Jack said: ""Sure. If you like.""
Rose said: ""I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.""
Jack said: ""They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely."""
"Jack said: ""I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.""
Rose said: ""Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson."""
"Rose said: ""Jack, must you go?""
Jack said: ""Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin."""
"Rose said: ""May I cut in, miss?""
Jack said: ""You're still my best girl, Cora."""
"Rose said: ""I don't know the steps.""
Jack said: ""Just move with me. Don't think."""
"Jack said: ""You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.""
Rose said: ""A mistake?""
Jack said: ""Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.""
Rose said: ""I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.""
Jack said: ""That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.""
Rose said: ""I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?"""
"Jack said: ""Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --""
Rose said: ""Jack, I --""
Jack said: ""No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright."""
"Rose said: ""You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.""
Jack said: ""I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.""
Rose said: ""It's not up to you to save me, Jack.""
Jack said: ""You're right. Only you can do that.""
Rose said: ""I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone."""
"Rose said: ""Fabrizio said you might be up --""
Jack said: ""Sssshh. Come here."""
"Rose said: ""Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?""
Jack said: ""Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!"""
"Rose said: ""Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.""
Jack said: ""Should I be expecting him anytime soon?""
Rose said: ""Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out."""
"Jack said: ""What is it? A sapphire?""
Rose said: ""A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean."""
"Rose said: ""I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.""
Jack said: ""He does landscapes."""
"Jack said: ""Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.""
Rose said: ""He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...""
Jack said: ""Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!"""
"Jack said: ""Where to, Miss?""
Rose said: ""To the stars."""
"Jack said: ""Are you nervous?""
Rose said: ""Au contraire, mon cher."""
"Rose said: ""You're trembling.""
Jack said: ""It's okay. I'm alright."""
"Rose said: ""When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.""
Jack said: ""This is crazy.""
Rose said: ""I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it."""
"Jack said: ""Looks okay. I don't see anything.""
Rose said: ""Could it have damaged the ship?""
Jack said: ""It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay."""
"Jack said: ""It's bad.""
Rose said: ""We have to tell Mother and Cal.""
Jack said: ""Now it's worse.""
Rose said: ""Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?""
Jack said: ""Right."""
"Jack said: ""This is horseshit.""
Rose said: ""Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --"""
"Jack said: ""Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!""
Rose said: ""He couldn't have."""
"Jack said: ""That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.""
Rose said: ""I know, I know.""
Jack said: ""See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one."""
"Jack said: ""So... how did you find out I didn't do it?""
Rose said: ""I didn't.  I just realized I already knew."""
"Jack said: ""You have to go for help.""
Rose said: ""I'll be right back.""
Jack said: ""I'll wait here."""
"Rose said: ""Will this work?""
Jack said: ""We'll find out."""
"Rose said: ""I'm not going without you.""
Jack said: ""Get in the boat, Rose."""
"Rose said: ""You jump, I jump, right?""
Jack said: ""Right."""
"Jack said: ""Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.""
Rose said: ""It's so cold.""
Jack said: ""I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around."""
"Rose said: ""It's getting quiet.""
Jack said: ""Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized..."""
"Jack said: ""No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.""
Rose said: ""I'm so cold.""
Jack said: ""You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?""
Rose said: ""I can't feel my body.""
Jack said: ""Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me."""
"Jack said: ""You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.""
Rose said: ""I promise.""
Jack said: ""Never let go.""
Rose said: ""I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go."""
"Lightoller said: ""I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.""
Smith said: ""Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.""
Lightoller said: ""It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.""
Smith said: ""Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.""
Lightoller said: ""Yes sir.""
Smith said: ""And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful."""
"Lizzy said: ""April 14, 1912.""
Lovett said: ""If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery."""
"Lovett said: ""Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?""
Lizzy said: ""That's enough."""
"Lovett said: ""Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.""
Lizzy said: ""What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.""
Lovett said: ""Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.""
Lizzy said: ""You think she was really there?""
Lovett said: ""Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there."""
"Lizzy said: ""I'm sorry.""
Lovett said: ""We were pissin' in the wind the whole time."""
"Lovett said: ""Is your stateroom alright?""
Rose said: ""Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me."""
"Rose said: ""There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.""
Lovett said: ""Would you like anything?""
Rose said: ""I should like to see my drawing."""
"Lovett said: ""Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.""
Rose said: ""It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once."""
"Lovett said: ""I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?""
Rose said: ""Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.""
Lovett said: ""Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?"""
"Rose said: ""It's been 84 years...""
Lovett said: ""Just tell us what you can --""
Rose said: ""It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in."""
"Rose said: ""I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...""
Lovett said: ""Well, that's the general idea, my dear."""
"Lovett said: ""Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?""
Rose said: ""I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett."""
"Rose said: ""Don't come any closer.""
Lovett said: ""You had it the entire time?!"""
"Ruth said: ""My God, Rose, what's gotten into --""
Rose said: ""Excuse me."""
"Rose said: ""Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.""
Ruth said: ""Charmed, I'm sure."""
"Ruth said: ""Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!""
Rose said: ""Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!""
Ruth said: ""Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play."""
"Ruth said: ""I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.""
Rose said: ""How can you put this on my shoulders?"""
"Ruth said: ""Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?""
Rose said: ""It's so unfair.""
Ruth said: ""Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy."""
"Ruth said: ""Rose, get in the boat!""
Rose said: ""Goodbye, mother."""
"Lother said: ""Anya!""
Anya said: ""Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here."""
"Lother said: ""Anya, I think you're crazy.""
Anya said: ""Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.""
Lother said: ""I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you."""
"Anya said: ""Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?""
Lother said: ""Do you want the truth, Anya?""
Anya said: ""It would be a nice change from you.""
Lother said: ""I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.""
Anya said: ""You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--""
Lother said: ""How'd you ever get away with it?""
Anya said: ""When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.""
Lother said: ""Sure!""
Anya said: ""I never want to go back...."""
"Anya said: ""Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?""
Lother said: ""Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.""
Anya said: ""That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life."""
"Lother said: ""But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.""
Anya said: ""I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?"""
"Anya said: ""Hope we're not intruding.""
Lother said: ""This is Miss Marsh.""
Anya said: ""Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?"""
"Anya said: ""Well--shall we go into dinner?""
Lother said: ""I'll join you later.""
Anya said: ""And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit."""
"Anya said: ""So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.""
Lother said: ""I can explain--""
Anya said: ""Sure! You're never at a loss for words."""
"Anya said: ""Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?""
Lother said: ""Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.""
Anya said: ""Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?""
Lother said: ""You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?""
Anya said: ""Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.""
Lother said: ""I didn't ask you to come away with me--""
Anya said: ""Oh--a hundred times--""
Lother said: ""--and I can tell you where to get off.""
Anya said: ""And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!""
Lother said: ""Will you leave me alone?""
Anya said: ""I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?""
Lother said: ""Baloney!""
Anya said: ""No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth."""
"Brett said: ""I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--""
Anya said: ""I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip."""
"Anya said: ""Feeling a little better, I see.""
Brett said: ""Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson."""
"Brett said: ""Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?""
Anya said: ""Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope."""
"Anya said: ""Good afternoon--""
Brett said: ""Glad to see you again."""
"Brett said: ""I hope so.""
Anya said: ""That's a date."""
"Brett said: ""Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.""
Anya said: ""We'll save you a place at our table.""
Brett said: ""Thanks."""
"Brett said: ""Isn't she lovely?""
Anya said: ""Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--"""
"Anya said: ""No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--""
Brett said: ""Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?"""
"Sally said: ""How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.""
Anya said: ""Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards."""
"Sally said: ""You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.""
Anya said: ""Sorry I can't return the compliment.""
Sally said: ""You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.""
Anya said: ""I don't understand.""
Sally said: ""I think you do."""
"Summers said: ""A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.""
Anya said: ""Montana?""
Summers said: ""Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--""Honest Jack""--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world."""
"Summers said: ""--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.""
Anya said: ""Isn't that interesting?"""
"Anya said: ""You'll excuse me.""
Summers said: ""Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game."""
"Summers said: ""Will you pardon me?""
Anya said: ""<U>Gladly</U>."""
"Summers said: ""You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--""
Anya said: ""I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later."""
"Summers said: ""Did you find it?""
Anya said: ""No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?""
Summers said: ""No-o!""
Anya said: ""Where's Lother?"""
"Mckinney said: ""Where'd you get it?""
Ballinger said: ""Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.""
Mckinney said: ""What did you want a gun for?""
Ballinger said: ""Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.""
Mckinney said: ""Is that why you killed Lee Lother?""
Ballinger said: ""Guess again, copper.""
Mckinney said: ""Get moving--"""
"Brett said: ""Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.""
Lother said: ""We'll be expecting you."""
"Lother said: ""We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?""
Brett said: ""Not at all."""
"Brett said: ""Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.""
Lother said: ""If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink."""
"Lother said: ""I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.""
Brett said: ""I'll bet a couple of hundred."""
"Brett said: ""Aces full.""
Lother said: ""And me coming in with two pair--"""
"Lother said: ""You're coming back--""
Brett said: ""That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?"""
"Lother said: ""How about a little game later?""
Brett said: ""Fine--I'll be glad to."""
"Lother said: ""Could I see you a minute?""
Brett said: ""Sure!  Excuse me."""
"Lother said: ""No gentleman would do that.""
Brett said: ""I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards."""
"Lother said: ""In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.""
Brett said: ""Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.""
Lother said: ""I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage."""
"Lother said: ""And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.""
Brett said: ""I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --""Honest Jack""! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets."""
"Sally said: ""I'm so sorry!""
Brett said: ""Want to take it back?"""
"Sally said: ""I thought you were one of my friends.""
Brett said: ""I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>""
Sally said: ""Yes--are you?""
Brett said: ""I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.""
Sally said: ""She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.""
Brett said: ""I'll say she is!""
Sally said: ""Nice lines--""
Brett said: ""Yes--"""
"Sally said: ""Like her paint job?""
Brett said: ""Very much--""
Sally said: ""You've got lipstick all over you.""
Brett said: ""I could stand some more--""
Sally said: ""--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.""
Brett said: ""No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>."""
"Brett said: ""Where have you been hiding?""
Sally said: ""Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.""
Brett said: ""Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?""
Sally said: ""So you washed it off!""
Brett said: ""How about giving me another coat?""
Sally said: ""Good-by.""
Brett said: ""Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--""
Sally said: ""Good-by!""
Brett said: ""There's soft music--""
Sally said: ""--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.""
Brett said: ""Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board."""
"Brett said: ""This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.""
Sally said: ""You're not very ambitious, are you?""
Brett said: ""Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.""
Sally said: ""You work too fast for me, young man.""
Brett said: ""Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?""
Sally said: ""Never eat before the show.""
Brett said: ""Well--breakfast?  Lunch?"""
"Sally said: ""This is Mr.--er--""
Brett said: ""Brett is the name.""
Sally said: ""Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney."""
"Brett said: ""Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.""
Sally said: ""You <U>are</U> a lunatic!""
Brett said: ""Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts."""
"Brett said: ""You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.""
Sally said: ""Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.""
Brett said: ""Married?""
Sally said: ""Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?""
Brett said: ""I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.""
Sally said: ""What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?""
Brett said: ""Tell me.""
Sally said: ""A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--""
Brett said: ""--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!"""
"Brett said: ""Isn't she attractive?""
Sally said: ""Very--your mother?""
Brett said: ""Don't be a c-a-t.""
Sally said: ""You asked me to dine with you tonight.""
Brett said: ""Yes?""
Sally said: ""Well, I can't.""
Brett said: ""Don't rub it in.""
Sally said: ""But I'll have cocktails with you.""
Brett said: ""When?""
Sally said: ""At seven-thirty?""
Brett said: ""Sooner it you like.""
Sally said: ""Okay.""
Brett said: ""Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.""
Sally said: ""Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women."""
"Brett said: ""See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.""
Sally said: ""I'll be there--Good-by."""
"Sally said: ""I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.""
Brett said: ""You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.""
Sally said: ""I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering."""
"Sally said: ""A little.""
Brett said: ""Sorry.""
Sally said: ""Thanks.""
Brett said: ""Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you."""
"Sally said: ""Mighty decent of you, pal.""
Brett said: ""Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested."""
"Sally said: ""What are you thinking?""
Brett said: ""A lot of things I'd like to forget.""
Sally said: ""That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental""
Brett said: ""I can't blame the ocean--it's you.""
Sally said: ""You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here."""
"Sally said: ""Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.""
Brett said: ""For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!""
Sally said: ""Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.""
Brett said: ""But--""
Sally said: ""--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.""
Brett said: ""Sally--!""
Sally said: ""Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.""
Brett said: ""You mean that?""
Sally said: ""Don't let's talk about it.""
Brett said: ""You said it! How about a little action?"""
"Brett said: ""Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?""
Sally said: ""Yes--is it all right if I come like this?""
Sally said: ""This time I'm really glad you showed up.""
Brett said: ""Lonesome?""
Sally said: ""We'll let it go at that--"""
"Sally said: ""What, again?""
Brett said: ""Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--""
Sally said: ""What?--""
Brett said: ""I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?""
Sally said: ""I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.""
Brett said: ""You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--""
Sally said: ""You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--""
Brett said: ""I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?""
Sally said: ""I think we ought to walk."""
"Brett said: ""Good night, Mrs. Brett!""
Sally said: ""Good night, idiot!"""
"Sally said: ""I could see you were pining away--""
Brett said: ""Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?""
Sally said: ""Yes--I remember--"""
"Sally said: ""How well do you know her?""
Brett said: ""Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.""
Sally said: ""Who with?""
Brett said: ""A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.""
Sally said: ""Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?""
Brett said: ""Lose?--I won a little--""
Sally said: ""That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--""
Brett said: ""What do you know about them?""
Sally said: ""Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--""
Brett said: ""You can live that down, can't you?""
Sally said: ""He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!"""
"Brett said: ""You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!""
Sally said: ""I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.""
Brett said: ""Come on--let's take a swim."""
"Sally said: ""I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.""
Brett said: ""Make it five.""
Sally said: ""Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.""
Brett said: ""I'll be waiting on deck."""

Sally said: ""Jimmy!"""
"Brett said: ""Well, I'll be--!!!""
Sally said: ""What's the matter?"""
"Brett said: ""Not here--follow me around the shed.""
Brett said: ""Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?""
Shortie said: ""Oh, putting on the swell, eh?""
Brett said: ""I thought you were a smart guy.""
Shortie said: ""If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.""
Brett said: ""We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?""
Shortie said: ""We coulda got two third-class!""
Brett said: ""No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.""
Shortie said: ""Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.""
Brett said: ""It'll never hurt you---Got any money?""
Shortie said: ""A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!""
Brett said: ""No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.""
Shortie said: ""I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents."""
"Brett said: ""Nix, the law!""
Shortie said: ""Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!"""
"Brett said: ""He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.""
Shortie said: ""I'll watch for him, sir."""
"Brett said: ""Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.""
Shortie said: ""Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away."""
"Shortie said: ""You're a wise guy--Gimme back--""
Brett said: ""Shortie, look!"""
"Shortie said: ""You don't think--?""
Brett said: ""Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is."""
"Shortie said: ""Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.""
Brett said: ""Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?""
Shortie said: ""Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.""
Brett said: ""How're the tips?""
Shortie said: ""A dollar forty.""
Brett said: ""I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.""
Shortie said: ""Not a chance.""
Brett said: ""Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.""
Shortie said: ""Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.""
Brett said: ""Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?""
Shortie said: ""Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon."""
"Brett said: ""Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--""
Shortie said: ""--there's thousands of 'em!""
Brett said: ""A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!"""
"Shortie said: ""This is a business trip!""
Brett said: ""She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.""
Shortie said: ""Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?""
Brett said: ""Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her."""
"Brett said: ""Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?""
Shortie said: ""No, sir?""
Brett said: ""My change.""
Shortie said: ""Change?""
Brett said: ""A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you."""
"Brett said: ""Shortie!--you know my motto?""
Shortie said: ""Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.""
Brett said: ""Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.""
Shortie said: ""Now you're talkin'!"""
"Brett said: ""Inspector McKinney.""
Shortie said: ""Are you screwy?""
Brett said: ""I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.""
Shortie said: ""You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--"""
"Brett said: ""Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.""
Shortie said: ""You take some awful chances.""
Brett said: ""Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed."""
"Brett said: ""They won't squawk--they're professionals.""
Shortie said: ""Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?""
Brett said: ""That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--"""
"Brett said: ""Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.""
Shortie said: ""Yes, Mr. Brett--right away."""
"Shortie said: ""Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.""
Brett said: ""Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.""
Shortie said: ""Thank you, sir.""
Brett said: ""I'll take one."""
"Shortie said: ""Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.""
Brett said: ""What is it?""
Shortie said: ""Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.""
Brett said: ""Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?"""
"Brett said: ""About sixteen hundred.""
Shortie said: ""Partners, ain't we?""
Brett said: ""Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred."""
"Brett said: ""You keep it--""
Shortie said: ""<U>Me</U>!""
Brett said: ""Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--"""
"Shortie said: ""Say--wait a minute!""
Brett said: ""See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool."""
"Shortie said: ""Hello, Jimmy. What's up?""
Brett said: ""Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?""
Shortie said: ""Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.""
Brett said: ""Where did you hide it?""
Shortie said: ""On the drunk.""
Brett said: ""Get it!"""
"Summers said: ""Come in!""
Brett said: ""Hope I didn't keep you waiting."""
"Brett said: ""I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.""
Summers said: ""Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?""
Brett said: ""Three Jacks.""
Summers said: ""That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett."""
"Summers said: ""It's your deal.""
Brett said: ""It's a pleasure."""
"Summers said: ""How's your mother feeling?""
Brett said: ""Much better--thank you--"""
"Brett said: ""Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.""
Summers said: ""Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?""
Brett said: ""Why isn't that a good time to quit?"""
"Summers said: ""I thought you were a sucker--""
Brett said: ""Think again--"""
"Summers said: ""That goes two ways.""
Brett said: ""Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat."""
"Mckinney said: ""I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.""
Brett said: ""Oh, yes. On the pier.""
Mckinney said: ""Before that. Your face is very familiar.""
Brett said: ""Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?""
Mckinney said: ""No--not quite."""
"Brett said: ""I'm going to the show--""
Mckinney said: ""I'll go with you--"""
"Brett said: ""Care to join us?""
Mckinney said: ""No, thanks--I never gambled in my life."""
"Brett said: ""This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--""
Mckinney said: ""Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--""
Brett said: ""It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--""
Mckinney said: ""Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--""
Brett said: ""If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--""
Mckinney said: ""I wouldn't be surprised--"""
"Brett said: ""I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?""
Mckinney said: ""No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--""
Brett said: ""Good night!"""
"Brett said: ""Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.""
Mckinney said: ""Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?"""
"Mckinney said: ""How about you?""
Brett said: ""No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.""
Mckinney said: ""You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.""
Brett said: ""Why?""
Mckinney said: ""Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?""
Brett said: ""Sure, I'll go.""
Mckinney said: ""I'll go with you.""
Brett said: ""Swell!"""
"Mckinney said: ""It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.""
Brett said: ""How about trying your fine Italian hand?""
Mckinney said: ""This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.""
Brett said: ""Hey!--you're tickling me.""
Mckinney said: ""Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?"""
"Mckinney said: ""Hello, young fellow!""
Brett said: ""Coming to the pool for a swim?""
Mckinney said: ""Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one."""
"Mckinney said: ""Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.""
Brett said: ""It's a bet--come on, Sally!"""
"Mckinney said: ""Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.""
Brett said: ""Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back."""
"Brett said: ""Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--""
Mckinney said: ""Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--"""
"Brett said: ""Don't get yourself all worked up--""
Mckinney said: ""You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?"""
"Mckinney said: ""Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?""
Brett said: ""Why, I--"""
"Brett said: ""Here's your fifty.""
Mckinney said: ""Thanks. That makes us square."""
"Denby said: ""Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.""
Brett said: ""Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?"""
"Denby said: ""No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.""
Brett said: ""Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.""
Denby said: ""O.K. Heads you win."""
"Denby said: ""That's too bad.""
Brett said: ""I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.""
Denby said: ""I'm sorry to hear that."""
"Denby said: ""That's all right. I'll attend to this.""
Brett said: ""Wait a minute--let's match for it.""
Denby said: ""Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time."""
"Brett said: ""Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?""
Denby said: ""No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--""
Brett said: ""She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.""
Denby said: ""I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it."""
"Denby said: ""I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?""
Brett said: ""I should say not.""
Denby said: ""Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!"""
"Denby said: ""I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.""
Brett said: ""She did?""
Denby said: ""Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?""
Brett said: ""Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.""
Denby said: ""O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.""
Brett said: ""What's that?""
Denby said: ""If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--"""
"Shortie said: ""Here you are, sir.""
Dan said: ""What'll I say?"""
"Shortie said: ""Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.""
Dan said: ""How?"""
"Shortie said: ""Where do you live?""
Dan said: ""In New York.""
Shortie said: ""Your wife knows that, don't she?""
Dan said: ""Sure.""
Shortie said: ""Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York."""
"Shortie said: """"Will be back in four weeks""--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!""
Dan said: ""That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.""
Shortie said: ""Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.""
Dan said: ""How?""
Shortie said: """"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks."" You don't need the ""will be."" Just say ""Back in four weeks.""""
Dan said: ""That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty."""
"Shortie said: ""Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  ""Back in four weeks."" Instead of ""in four weeks""--say ""next month""--That saves another word.""
Dan said: ""Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it."""
"Shortie said: ""Just a minute--I don't think we need the word ""Back"" --Where <U>is</U> ""Back""?""
Dan said: ""Back is in New York.""
Shortie said: ""Your wife knows that, don't she?""
Dan said: ""Sure.""
Shortie said: ""Cut it out."""
"Shortie said: ""Now we get it down to two words--""next month.""""
Dan said: ""Send that.""
Shortie said: ""Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?""
Dan said: ""Next month is June.""
Shortie said: ""Fine! Instead of saying ""next month""--we'll use one word and say ""June.""""
Dan said: ""June? That's my wife's name.""
Shortie said: ""That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.""
Dan said: ""O.K.! Send that!""
Shortie said: ""Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?""
Dan said: ""Sure.""
Shortie said: ""Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!""
Dan said: ""Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company."""

Denby said: ""Oh,--we're doing about thirty--""
Dan said: ""Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--""

Denby said: ""I thought I put you to bed.""
Dan said: ""Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.""
Denby said: ""Well, did you find me?""
Dan said: ""Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?""
Denby said: ""This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.""
Dan said: ""That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife."""
"Denby said: ""Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?""
Dan said: ""She's in New York."""
"Denby said: ""Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.""
Dan said: ""That's fine."""

Dan said: ""Who won?""
Denby said: ""Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.""
Dan said: ""I was never stiffer in my life.""
Denby said: ""All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--"""

Mary said: ""Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?""

Mckinney said: ""Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?""
Denby said: ""Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.""
Mckinney said: ""Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.""

Sally said: ""I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--""
Denby said: ""Do what--""
Sally said: ""You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.""
Denby said: ""News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--""
Sally said: ""It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.""
Denby said: ""I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?""
Sally said: ""I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.""
Denby said: ""I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--""

Denby said: ""Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.""
Sally said: ""Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--""
Denby said: ""But not nice enough to marry--eh?""

Denby said: ""I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.""
Lother said: ""Meaning what?""
Denby said: ""You don't shoot squirrels."""

"Denby said: ""Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--""Gee you're tight.""-- and the window says--""You loosen up a bit and so will I.""--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?""
Ned said: ""Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--""
Denby said: ""Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?""
Ned said: ""No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--"""
"Denby said: ""What happened to you?""
Ned said: ""You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?""
Denby said: ""What for?""
Ned said: ""Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.""
Denby said: ""Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you."""
"Lother said: ""You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.""
Summers said: ""Eh?... Oh.""
Lother said: ""He works the boats as a ""come-on"" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.""
Summers said: ""There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker."""
"Summers said: ""That's him! That's the sucker!!""
Lother said: ""Looks lonesome--Bring him over here."""
"Lother said: ""Can you read 'em Jack?""
Summers said: ""They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds.""
Lother said: ""The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.""
Summers said: ""The country boy's about due.""
Lother said: ""Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified."""
"Summers said: ""Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.""
Lother said: ""Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you."""
"Lother said: ""How much did you lose?""
Summers said: ""About twelve hundred.""
Lother said: ""I went for four.""
Summers said: ""It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later."""
"Sally said: ""All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.""
Lother said: ""You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.""
Sally said: ""I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.""
Lother said: ""It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.""
Sally said: ""Why don't you leave me alone?""
Lother said: ""Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?""
Sally said: ""I wish I could.""
Lother said: ""Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story."""
"Sally said: ""You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?""
Lother said: ""That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?""
Sally said: ""He's all right.""
Lother said: ""Thanks to me.""
Sally said: ""You leave the kid alone.""
Lother said: ""A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--""
Sally said: ""--you'd go with him!""
Lother said: ""Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there."""
"Sally said: ""Not because of Ned.""
Lother said: ""Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?""
Sally said: ""You can't bluff me any more."""
"Sally said: ""I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?""
Lother said: ""Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.""
Sally said: ""--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?""
Lother said: ""That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--"""
"Sally said: ""Don't, Lee--that's dead.""
Lother said: ""Let's see if I can bring it back to life."""
"Lother said: ""Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--""
Sally said: ""I've lost my taste for knickknacks--""
Lother said: ""Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?""
Sally said: ""Have you ever figured they might extradite you?""
Lother said: ""I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--"""
"Lother said: ""I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.""
Sally said: ""Not a chance--I'm through."""
"Ned said: ""Yes, Yes!""
Mckinney said: ""You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?""
Ned said: ""No!""
Mckinney said: ""S'pose you've never thought of killing him--""
Ned said: ""I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--""
Mckinney said: ""Why?""
Ned said: ""Because I was yellow, I guess--"""
"Ned said: ""I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--""
Mckinney said: ""This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?"""
"Sally said: ""It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!""
Mckinney said: ""Good night!"""
"Mckinney said: ""Congratulations.""
Sally said: ""Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?""
Mckinney said: ""He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?""
Sally said: ""Say, ""Thanks very much!""""
Mckinney said: ""I mean if you knew it were stolen.""
Sally said: ""Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.""
Mckinney said: ""And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?""
Sally said: ""Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.""
Mckinney said: ""Maybe you will after you've thought it over."""
"Sally said: ""That's the truth--every single word!""
Mckinney said: ""I sincerely hope so--""
Sally said: ""Why should <U>I</U> kill him?""
Mckinney said: ""For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it."""
"Mckinney said: ""Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.""
Sally said: ""I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.""
Mckinney said: ""I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you."""
"Mckinney said: ""Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.""
Sally said: ""He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million."""
"Purser said: ""There you are, sir.""
Mckinney said: ""Thank you.""
Purser said: ""Thirty one's and two ten's?"""
"Purser said: ""He's certainly good-natured.""
Mckinney said: """"Smooth's"" the word.""
Purser said: ""I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.""
Mckinney said: ""It all depends on what you're used to."""
"Mckinney said: ""Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!""
Purser said: ""What's the matter?""
Mckinney said: ""Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks."""
"Ned said: ""I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.""
Sally said: ""Do you think Lother could have seen it?"""
"Sally said: ""Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.""
Ned said: ""Sure, Sis.""
Sally said: ""Aren't the roses beautiful?"""
"Sally said: ""I'm all right.""
Ned said: ""You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?""
Sally said: ""I was in his cabin--""
Ned said: ""What!--are you crazy?""
Sally said: ""I'll explain later--""

Steward said: ""I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.""
Shortie said: ""Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.""
Steward said: ""Then why did you run away?""
Shortie said: ""Because you ran after me."""

"Minister Johnstone said: ""Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?""
Admiral Roebuck said: ""I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -""
Minister Johnstone said: ""And I have the entire British economy to worry about."""
"Minister Johnstone said: ""At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?""
Admiral Roebuck said: ""36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.""
Minister Johnstone said: ""I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?"""
"Harmsway said: ""Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.""
Bond said: ""You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers."""
"Bond said: ""It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.""
Harmsway said: ""I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife."""
"Harmsway said: ""I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.""
Bond said: ""Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?""
Harmsway said: ""A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.""
Bond said: ""We'll see about that."""
"Bond said: ""How did you get this number?""
Harmsway said: ""Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?""
Bond said: ""I'm on my way."""
"Harmsway said: ""Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.""
Bond said: ""Sir Elliot.""
Harmsway said: ""Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk."""
"Harmsway said: ""Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.""
Bond said: ""I see.""
Harmsway said: ""I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.""
Bond said: ""I wonder if it runs in the family.""
Harmsway said: ""The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success."""
"Harmsway said: ""Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.""
Bond said: ""I can feel your pain."""
"Harmsway said: ""By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?""
Bond said: ""Sightseeing."""
"Harmsway said: ""I call this the Rogue's gallery.""
Bond said: ""Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.""
Harmsway said: ""My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.""
Bond said: ""So why did you leave?""
Harmsway said: ""Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow?  In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but...  I turned it into this"""
"Harmsway said: ""Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.""
Bond said: ""And still not a thing to watch."""
"Bond said: ""...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.""
Harmsway said: ""They're merely tools to disseminate information.""
Bond said: ""Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?""
Harmsway said: ""Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you."""
"Harmsway said: ""You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.""
Bond said: ""...Words to live by?""
Harmsway said: ""Your choice.  Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing."""
"Bond said: ""Briefly.""
Harmsway said: ""Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?"""
"Harmsway said: ""...And what's that, my dear?""
Bond said: ""Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -"""
"Bond said: ""I'm sure they will.""
Harmsway said: ""Good-bye, Mister Bond."""
"Bond said: ""Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?""
Harmsway said: ""My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward."""
"Bond said: ""...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.""
Harmsway said: ""Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -""
Bond said: ""- Instant melt-down.""
Harmsway said: ""Chernobyl will look like a campfire."""
"Harmsway said: ""...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.""
Bond said: ""What about the gold?"""
"Bond said: ""I'd rather die alone.""
Harmsway said: ""Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea."""
"Captain Cheong said: ""In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.""
Bond said: ""I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.""
Captain Cheong said: ""Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.""
Bond said: ""I'm sorry.""
Captain Cheong said: ""The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.""
Bond said: ""Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?""
Captain Cheong said: ""Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'""
Bond said: ""I appreciate your time -""
Captain Cheong said: ""Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.""
Bond said: ""Where can I find him?""
Captain Cheong said: ""Him? He, is a she -  at the bar."""
"Moneypenny said: ""I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.""
Bond said: ""Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -""
Moneypenny said: ""Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room."""
"Bond said: ""4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.""
Moneypenny said: ""Four o'clock. Don't be late.""
Bond said: ""Tsi tien, Chien-penny.""
Moneypenny said: ""Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher."""
"Bond said: ""Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.""
Moneypenny said: ""Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?""
Bond said: ""In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera."""
"Moneypenny said: ""By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?""
Bond said: ""Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?"""
"Moneypenny said: ""Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -""
Bond said: ""- We all want what we can't have?""
Moneypenny said: ""Not all of us, 007."""
"Bond said: ""What - no lust for adventure?""
Moneypenny said: ""No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy."""
"Bond said: ""Q! How are you?""
Q said: ""Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.""
Bond said: ""I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -""
Q said: ""That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.""
Bond said: ""Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?""
Q said: ""Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.""
Bond said: ""Do I have to dial '9' to get out?""
Q said: ""I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -"""
"Q said: ""Your new car.""
Bond said: ""- Four wheel drive?""
Q said: ""Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.""
Bond said: ""... 17 Beverage cup holders?""
Q said: ""Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders."""
"Bond said: ""I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.""
Q said: ""Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters."""
"Bond said: ""Yes -""
Captain Morton said: ""Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!"""
"Bond said: ""Wait a minute -""
Captain Morton said: ""Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him."""
"Bond said: ""Don't you think you're overreacting?""
Captain Morton said: ""Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.""
Bond said: ""...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.""
Captain Morton said: ""What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?""
Bond said: ""Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.""
Captain Morton said: ""That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.""
Bond said: ""I know what I saw -"""
"Bond said: ""Paris?!? What are you doing here?""
Paris said: ""Is that any way to say hello?""
Bond said: ""I thought your specialty was good-bye."""
"Paris said: ""Oh, James. I've missed you -""
Bond said: ""Is this another one of your games?""
Paris said: ""Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?""
Bond said: ""I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense."""
"Paris said: ""Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?""
Bond said: ""Nothing."""
"Bond said: ""What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?""
Paris said: ""No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -"""
"Paris said: ""Do you feel better now?""
Bond said: ""Do you?"""
"Bond said: ""What about the uranium?""
Paris said: ""It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow."""
"Paris said: ""I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.""
Bond said: ""Shhhhh...""
Paris said: ""Just hold me."""
"Bond said: ""Paris -""
Paris said: ""Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!""
Bond said: ""Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?""
Paris said: ""He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!"""
"Paris said: ""Just - say it. Say it just once.""
Bond said: ""One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go."""
"Minister Johnstone said: ""His newspapers?""
Bond said: ""Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks."""
"Minister Johnstone said: ""More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.""
Bond said: ""Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.""
Minister Johnstone said: ""Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port ""Aberdeen Harbor"" in their honor?"""
"Minister Johnstone said: ""There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.""
Bond said: ""Political considerations?""
Minister Johnstone said: ""To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here."""
"Bond said: ""Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?""
Saunders said: ""Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -""
Bond said: ""Come on. I know better than that -"""
"Bond said: ""It must do something.""
Saunders said: ""Well... If you insist."""
"Saunders said: ""Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.""
Bond said: ""How is old Q?""
Saunders said: ""Gone fishing.""
Bond said: ""Fishing?""
Saunders said: ""Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA."""
"Bond said: ""Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -""
Saunders said: ""Not from forty feet."""
"Bond said: ""... Shoelaces?""
Saunders said: ""Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.""
Bond said: ""Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?""
Saunders said: ""Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.""
Bond said: ""Does it work on cash machines?"""
"Saunders said: ""It was an authorized test. I returned the money.""
Bond said: ""I see...""
Saunders said: ""Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.""
Bond said: ""If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?""
Saunders said: ""Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device."""
"Bond said: ""A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?""
Saunders said: ""I believe Q's exact words were:  ""Hopefully, nothing."""""
"Bond said: ""Wade, what the hell are you doing here?""
Wade said: ""I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.""
Bond said: ""That's reassuring.""
Wade said: ""Hey - the world is my office.""
Bond said: ""Let's take a look at the body."""
"Wade said: ""I don't know if you'd call it a boat...""
Bond said: ""Something with an engine? Not oars?""
Wade said: ""Step into my office."""
"Wade said: ""What do you want with the Harbor Master?""
Bond said: ""Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?""
Wade said: ""Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades."""
"Wade said: ""I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.""
Bond said: ""Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy."""
"Bond said: ""Natalya?""
Wade said: ""Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.""
Bond said: ""She married a hockey player.""
Wade said: ""I envy your 'undercover' assignments.""
Bond said: ""We work in the dark. We do what we can."""
"Bond said: ""I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?""
Wade said: ""Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.""
Bond said: ""Can you arrange a meeting?""
Wade said: ""Hell. The CIA built that club."""
"Wade said: ""Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?""
Bond said: ""He tied one on."""
"Wade said: ""I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?""
Bond said: ""Who knows? Fog, night...""
Wade said: ""They'd never sail this close to the shore.""
Bond said: ""Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!"""
"Wade said: ""I got you covered.""
Bond said: ""That's reassuring."""
"Bond said: ""Sidney Winch, meet -""
Wade said: ""Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -"""
"Wade said: ""Where to now, Jimbo?""
Bond said: ""I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur."""
"Bond said: ""Interesting presentation.""
Dominique said: ""Interesting video tape.""
Bond said: ""They point, I shoot.""
Dominique said: ""Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.""
Bond said: ""Of course."""
"Dominique said: ""... Does this do anything?""
Bond said: ""Depends what number you write."""
"Bond said: ""Married?""
Dominique said: ""Happily.""
Bond said: ""... Kids?""
Dominique said: ""Three. You? Married?""
Bond said: ""No.""
Dominique said: ""I didn't think so."""
"Dominique said: ""Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.""
Bond said: ""Thanks.  Take care -""
Dominique said: ""You too."""
"Sidney said: ""Bourbon. Neat.""
Bond said: ""I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat."""
"Sidney said: ""Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.""
Bond said: ""- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.""
Sidney said: ""Have we met?""
Bond said: ""This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.""
Sidney said: ""Sidney Winch."""
"Bond said: ""Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?""
Sidney said: ""No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro."""
"Bond said: ""Boyfriend?""
Sidney said: ""Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.""
Bond said: ""Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.""
Sidney said: ""So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?"""
"Bond said: ""Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.""
Sidney said: ""And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?""
Bond said: ""Insurance. Lloyds of London.""
Sidney said: ""The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.""
Bond said: ""I'll keep that in mind.""
Sidney said: ""I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.""
Bond said: ""Nice to run into you again.""
Sidney said: ""Let's not make it a habit."""
"Sidney said: ""- Shut up!""
Bond said: ""You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.""
Sidney said: ""No?""
Bond said: ""No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.""
Sidney said: ""So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies."""
"Sidney said: ""Do I have to do everything around here?""
Bond said: ""I hope so."""
"Bond said: ""I hope you'll be gentle.""
Sidney said: ""Think about mom."""
"Sidney said: ""And what do you call this?""
Bond said: ""- The family jewels?"""
"Bond said: ""If I were you -""
Sidney said: ""- You're not.""
Bond said: ""Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.""
Sidney said: ""Thank you.  ""Now hear this: Drop dead."""""
"Bond said: ""Why don't we just take these -""
Sidney said: ""No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them."""
"Bond said: ""... Do you have a gun?""
Sidney said: ""What?""
Bond said: ""You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.""
Sidney said: ""That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.""
Bond said: ""Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us."""
"Bond said: ""Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.""
Sidney said: ""Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!""
Bond said: ""Blood or Dutch?""
Sidney said: ""He was my father's best friend!""
Bond said: ""He's killed closer.""
Sidney said: ""You are seriously deranged.""
Bond said: ""Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?"""
"Sidney said: ""This has got to be a mistake.""
Bond said: ""The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator."""
"Bond said: ""Wait here.""
Sidney said: ""No. I'm going with you."""
"Bond said: ""... How did you get into marine salvage?""
Sidney said: ""My father left me the business."""
"Bond said: ""Not a lot of difference.""
Sidney said: ""What do you mean?"""
"Sidney said: ""What the hell does that do?""
Bond said: ""Cleans dirt. Let's go."""
"Sidney said: ""Down?""
Bond said: ""Up."""
"Sidney said: ""What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'""
Bond said: ""Trust me."""
"Bond said: ""Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.""
Sidney said: ""Are you listening to me?""
Bond said: ""Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.""
Sidney said: ""... We have time for that?"""
"Bond said: ""Sometimes you just have to -""
Sidney said: ""Don't say it."""
"Sidney said: ""Is this - like - a normal day for you?""
Bond said: ""It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits."""
"Bond said: ""Here. You shoot. I'll drive.""
Sidney said: ""...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.""
Bond said: ""Another reason??? Did I miss something???""
Sidney said: ""You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl."""
"Bond said: ""If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.""
Sidney said: ""If not?""
Bond said: ""We blast through."""
"Bond said: ""Sleep well?""
Sidney said: ""Next time, I do the driving."""
"Sidney said: ""What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?""
Bond said: ""I didn't say when I want to die -"""
"Bond said: ""... Yes???""
Sidney said: ""Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.""
Bond said: ""... Yes?""
Sidney said: ""First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.""
Bond said: ""And number two?""
Sidney said: ""If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.""
Bond said: ""And when might that be?""
Sidney said: ""Now."""
"M said: ""Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?""
Bond said: ""Yes, M."""
"M said: ""Come in, 007. You know the Minister?""
Bond said: ""Of course.  Minister Johnstone."""
"M said: ""Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?""
Bond said: ""Only what I read in the newspapers."""
"M said: ""- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -""
Bond said: ""'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press."""
"Bond said: ""... What's Harmsway done?""
M said: ""It seems, 007, we've received a tip"""
"M said: ""The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.""
Bond said: ""Of course.""
M said: ""Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.""
Bond said: ""... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?""
M said: ""Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -"""
"M said: ""You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.""
Bond said: ""I understand."""
"Bond said: "".... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?""
M said: ""We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect."""
"M said: ""But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.""
Bond said: ""Hopefully, it won't get that far."""
"Bond said: ""...I'll give you a ring from Venice.""
M said: ""Good luck on your mission, 007."""
"Bond said: ""Sorry I'm late -""
M said: ""Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?"""
"M said: ""...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.""
Bond said: ""I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?""
M said: ""What do you make of all this?""
Bond said: ""It doesn't quite add up."""
"Bond said: ""The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.""
M said: ""Sabotage?""
Bond said: ""A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air."""
"Bond said: ""... And what do you call these?""
Jenny Wu said: ""Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.""
Bond said: ""Indeed they are.  Deadly little things."""
"Bond said: ""And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?""
Jenny Wu said: ""Stop it!""
Bond said: ""I was just getting to the interesting part!""
Jenny Wu said: ""We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?""
Bond said: ""Remind me."""
"Jenny Wu said: ""Sakwa!""
Bond said: ""Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?""
Jenny Wu said: ""Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed."""
"Jenny Wu said: ""Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.""
Bond said: ""Tsi tien, Professor Wu."""
"Captain Morton said: ""Who's in charge here?""
Sidney said: ""I am. What do you want?""
Captain Morton said: ""You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.""
Sidney said: ""Forget it. No way. I got here first.""
Captain Morton said: ""Who's Wade?"""
"Sidney said: ""What's your name?""
Captain Morton said: ""Captain Morton."""
"Sidney said: ""My name is Sidney Winch, and -""
Captain Morton said: ""Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.""
Sidney said: ""I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.""
Captain Morton said: ""Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.""
Sidney said: ""I was an attorney!""
Captain Morton said: ""Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?""
Sidney said: ""No.""
Captain Morton said: ""You leave me no alternative."""
"Sidney said: ""You won't get away with this!""
Captain Morton said: ""Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground."""
"Executive Secretary said: ""The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -""
Harmsway said: ""Pencil it in for the next trip -""
Executive Secretary said: ""The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -""
Harmsway said: ""Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -""
Executive Secretary said: ""Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations""
Harmsway said: ""No -""
Executive Secretary said: ""The Queen invited you to dinner -""
Harmsway said: ""Yes -""
Executive Secretary said: ""And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.""
Harmsway said: ""Excellent."""
"Helmsman said: ""Damn. It's doing it again.""
First Officer said: ""What's wrong?""
Helmsman said: ""About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west."""
"Helmsman said: ""The back-up does the same thing.""
First Officer said: ""Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?"""
"First Officer said: ""How is it now?""
Helmsman said: ""Seems to be back to normal, sir."""
"First Officer said: ""A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!""
Helmsman said: ""Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.""
First Officer said: ""Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice."""
"Sidney said: ""What is HE doing here?""
Harmsway said: ""I see you two have met."""
"Harmsway said: ""Obviously, the British government denies all of this -""
Sidney said: ""- I told you! He was there! -""
Harmsway said: ""- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?"""
"Sidney said: ""He brought that up from the wreck.""
Harmsway said: ""...I see."""
"Harmsway said: ""...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!""
Sidney said: ""Thank you, Uncle Elliot.""
Harmsway said: ""No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later."""
"Harmsway said: ""How sweet.""
Sidney said: ""My timing always was lousy."""
"Yung said: ""That was too close.""
Harmsway said: ""Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss."""
"Yung said: ""The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.""
Harmsway said: ""Excellent."""
"Harmsway said: ""Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.""
Yung said: ""Approaching the first gate.""
Harmsway said: ""Start the grinders."""
"Harmsway said: ""Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.""
Yung said: ""Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -"""
"Harmsway said: ""Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!""
Yung said: ""You have to leave -""
Harmsway said: ""A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen."""

"Stamper said: ""They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!""
Harmsway said: ""I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!"""
"Harmsway said: ""- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?""
Stamper said: ""Yes. Shall we kill them?""
Harmsway said: ""No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve."""

Number Three said: ""Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment."""
"Harmsway said: ""... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?""
Number Three said: ""No sir! I swear! This is not true!!""

"Gideon said: ""What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.""
Babe Brother said: ""I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.""
Gideon said: ""That's a lie."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I pay my own way.""
Gideon said: ""Since when?"""
"Gideon said: ""Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.""
Babe Brother said: ""I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.""
Gideon said: ""What did your wife get her?""
Babe Brother said: ""We got the same thing."""
"Babe Brother said: ""Why, you don't want us to bring him over?""
Gideon said: ""No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.""
Babe Brother said: ""Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.""
Gideon said: ""Junior spends time with his child.""
Babe Brother said: ""Oh here we go with that."""
"Gideon said: ""Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?""
Babe Brother said: ""Yes.""
Gideon said: ""How come you're not wearing my shoes?""
Babe Brother said: ""They're too big."""
"Gideon said: ""When are you boys going to fix that roof?""
Babe Brother said: ""Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.""
Gideon said: ""Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen."""
"Junior said: ""When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?""
Babe Brother said: ""You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.""
Junior said: ""You used that excuse to get out of the army.""
Babe Brother said: ""You always got something to say."""
"Junior said: ""You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.""
Babe Brother said: ""Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?""
Junior said: ""This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.""
Babe Brother said: ""This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.""
Junior said: ""Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?""
Babe Brother said: ""Maybe I can get down there next week."""
"Junior said: ""Why in the hell didn't you help mama?""
Babe Brother said: ""I told her I would if she would give me time.""
Junior said: ""I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.""
Babe Brother said: ""You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.""
Junior said: ""That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.""
Babe Brother said: ""I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.""
Junior said: ""I ought to break your damn neck."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?""
Junior said: ""You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.""
Babe Brother said: ""My name is Sam. Samuel."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I'll drive her to the hospital.""
Junior said: ""We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.""
Junior said: ""What is it, noontime?"""
"Linda said: ""Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.""
Babe Brother said: ""My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.""
Linda said: ""I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.""
Babe Brother said: ""What is a sip of coffee going to do?""
Linda said: ""Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.""
Babe Brother said: ""I don't see you crying about my drinking it.""
Linda said: ""How old are you?"""
"Babe Brother said: ""Why don't you come in for a while?""
Linda said: ""I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea."""
"Linda said: ""You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.""
Babe Brother said: ""Will you still get the money from your father?""
Linda said: ""I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.""
Babe Brother said: ""Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.""
Linda said: ""We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.""
Babe Brother said: ""I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way..."""
"Babe Brother said: ""Why does he always pick on me?""
Linda said: ""He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.""
Babe Brother said: ""I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money."""
"Babe Brother said: ""Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?""
Linda said: ""Why in the h..."""
"Babe Brother said: ""You okay?""
Linda said: ""I'm okay. Go back to your friends."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.""
Linda said: ""Like a veil has been lifted?""
Babe Brother said: ""It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.""
Linda said: ""Like muddy waters?""
Babe Brother said: ""It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.""
Linda said: ""You were in hell?""
Babe Brother said: ""I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.""
Linda said: ""Do you think you won?""
Babe Brother said: ""It was nip and tuck.""
Linda said: ""And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?""
Babe Brother said: ""I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there."""
"Suzie said: ""Who is it?""
Babe Brother said: ""Babe Brother."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.""
Suzie said: ""This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.""
Babe Brother said: ""He will be alright."""
"Babe Brother said: ""Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?""
Suzie said: ""Well, you look better than you did yesterday."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.""
Suzie said: ""What for?""
Babe Brother said: ""I'm going back home with Harry.""
Suzie said: ""I've heard some foolish things in my life.""
Babe Brother said: ""Harry is coming to pick me up.""
Suzie said: ""Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.""
Babe Brother said: ""I'm busy.""
Suzie said: ""Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.""
Babe Brother said: ""Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.""
Suzie said: ""I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self."""
"Babe Brother said: ""Did you ever have to use this thing?""
Harry said: ""That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out."""
"Babe Brother said: ""Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?""
Harry said: ""I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me."""
"Babe Brother said: ""What is that?""
Harry said: ""Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor."""
"Harry said: ""Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?""
Babe Brother said: ""It is just a regular card.""
Harry said: ""Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere."""
"Harry said: ""Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.""
Babe Brother said: ""Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know."""
"Babe Brother said: ""I could swear I heard my son call me.""
Harry said: ""You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.""
Babe Brother said: ""I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong."""
"Harry said: ""I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.""
Babe Brother said: ""This would be a bad time for me to leave.""
Harry said: ""We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?"""
"Davis said: ""You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.""
Gideon said: ""I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.""
Davis said: ""Not anymore, not in the city.""
Gideon said: ""We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.""
Davis said: ""Well, you just have to move further out.""
Gideon said: ""Now how far would further out be?""
Davis said: ""I'm not here to argue, sir."""
"Gideon said: ""My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?""
Suzie said: ""Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom."""
"Gideon said: ""Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.""
Suzie said: ""Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.""
Gideon said: ""I don't know how two brothers can be so different."""
"Suzie said: ""Let us settle this tomorrow.""
Gideon said: ""Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs."""
"Gideon said: ""Your feet are cold.""
Suzie said: ""Go back to sleep.""
Gideon said: ""I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.""
Suzie said: ""You all act like two roosters.""
Gideon said: ""I'm not going to let him get away with murder.""
Suzie said: ""You and Babe Brother are so much alike...""
Gideon said: ""He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.""
Suzie said: ""Hush.""
Gideon said: ""You're always taking his side.""
Suzie said: ""Hush.""
Gideon said: ""I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.""
Suzie said: ""You're going to find yourself on the floor."""
"Suzie said: ""You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.""
Gideon said: ""Babe Brother is a poor boy."""
"Gideon said: ""Well, it's up to Suzie.""
Suzie said: ""It would be nice."""
"Suzie said: ""Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.""
Gideon said: ""No, I'm too hot now.""
Suzie said: ""You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.""
Gideon said: ""I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.""
Suzie said: ""Gideon, don't say things like that."""
"Gideon said: ""Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.""
Suzie said: ""No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further."""
"Gideon said: ""I'm worn out.""
Suzie said: ""Just stay in bed and rest.""
Gideon said: ""I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.""
Suzie said: ""You stay inside. I will see to them.""
Gideon said: ""I will appreciate that."""
"Gideon said: ""It's good to be able to hear that.""
Suzie said: ""You must have been really sick.""
Gideon said: ""How is the garden doing?""
Suzie said: ""I need to get out there and get those weeds out.""
Gideon said: ""How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick."""
"Gideon said: ""What, are you having another party?""
Suzie said: ""You better come sit down. You are still sick.""
Gideon said: ""Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?"""
"Suzie said: ""Since this morning.""
Gideon said: ""What happened to your hand?""
Suzie said: ""I cut it on an old rusty knife."""
"Gideon said: ""What did you put on it?""
Suzie said: ""It's healing now."""
"Gideon said: ""He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, ""I thought the streets were paved with gold."" ""They are but you won't see them,"" he said. ""Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness."" So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. ""Man, this is a dream."" He asked, ""What's you'll doing?"" They all hollered back, ""Sinning."" The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, ""Please to meet you."" He asked, ""I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire."" Someone said, ""Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins."" The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...""
Suzie said: ""I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.""
Gideon said: ""I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.""
Suzie said: ""I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...""
Gideon said: ""But these are white people, anybody. The punch...""
Suzie said: ""I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.""
Gideon said: ""It's only a tale."""
"Gideon said: ""This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.""
Harry said: ""He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age."""
"Harry said: ""Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.""
Gideon said: ""He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry."""
"Harry said: ""I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.""
Gideon said: ""Why didn't you catch a plane?""
Harry said: ""My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.""
Gideon said: ""Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.""
Harry said: ""I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?"""
"Gideon said: ""Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.""
Harry said: ""Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor."""
"Gideon said: ""Man, act like this is your home.""
Harry said: ""That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome."""
"Gideon said: ""It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window""
Harry said: ""I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me."""
"Harry said: ""Good morning.""
Gideon said: ""You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.""
Harry said: ""Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.""
Gideon said: ""I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.""
Harry said: ""Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.""
Gideon said: ""Well, I would appreciate that."""
"Harry said: ""How often is your wife called to help delivery?""
Gideon said: ""It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home."""
"Gideon said: ""What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.""
Harry said: ""Everything these days is made overseas.""
Gideon said: ""You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.""
Harry said: ""Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.""
Gideon said: ""I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.""
Harry said: ""Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.""
Gideon said: ""You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.""
Harry said: ""You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.""
Gideon said: ""My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.""
Harry said: ""'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead."""
"Gideon said: ""Haven't the years been good to Hattie?""
Harry said: ""It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life."""
"Harry said: ""Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.""
Gideon said: ""I tell you, I feel like a ghost."""
"Suzie said: ""Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.""
Harry said: ""Well, I don't want to put you out."""
"Harry said: ""Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.""
Suzie said: ""You should go back and rest.""
Harry said: ""No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?"""
"Suzie said: ""One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.""
Harry said: ""Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place."""
"Suzie said: ""Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.""
Harry said: ""You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say ""go on in there brick and hit somebody"" and it would find its mark.""
Suzie said: ""I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.""
Harry said: ""All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is."""
"Suzie said: ""I have someone I want you to meet.""
Harry said: ""I'll be right there."""
"Suzie said: ""Harry, you know everything.""
Harry said: ""You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything."""
"Harry said: ""What's the problem here?""
Suzie said: ""She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil."""
"Harry said: ""How is everybody?""
Suzie said: ""Tolerable well."""
"Harry said: ""Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?""
Suzie said: ""He wasn't able to get out of bed today.""
Harry said: ""I hope that it's nothing serious.""
Suzie said: ""He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.""
Harry said: ""Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time."""
"Suzie said: ""Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.""
Harry said: ""You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right."""
"Harry said: ""That smells like fresh coffee.""
Suzie said: ""Let me get you a cup?""
Harry said: ""Only if you can spare it."""
"Harry said: ""How is he doing?""
Suzie said: ""As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.""
Harry said: ""I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway."""
"Harry said: ""Good afternoon, ladies.""
Suzie said: ""Good afternoon to you."""
"Harry said: ""As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.""
Suzie said: ""You must have done something to her.""
Harry said: ""Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.""
Suzie said: ""Hattie is a different person now.""
Harry said: ""I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?""
Suzie said: ""I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.""
Harry said: ""You invited me.""
Suzie said: ""Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?"""
"Marsh said: ""There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?""
Harry said: ""Now who are we talking about?""
Marsh said: ""Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...""
Harry said: ""Wasn't Hocker lynched?""
Marsh said: ""You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?""
Harry said: ""What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?"""
"Marsh said: ""Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.""
Harry said: ""Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason."""
"Harry said: ""I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.""
Marsh said: ""Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.""
Harry said: ""Those boys never did have good luck.""
Marsh said: ""You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.""
Harry said: ""Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth."""
"Harry said: ""A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.""
Pat said: ""That's nice.""
Harry said: ""Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor."""
"Harry said: ""How many people do you all feed?""
Pat said: ""Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.""
Harry said: ""Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.""
Pat said: ""Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.""
Harry said: ""Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste."""
"Pat said: ""I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.""
Harry said: ""Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there."""
"Hattie said: ""I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?""
Harry said: ""Girl, do you still sing and dance?""
Hattie said: ""No, I'm a different person now, Harry."""
"Hattie said: ""Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.""
Harry said: ""Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.""
Hattie said: ""Some people grow up and change their ways.""
Harry said: ""I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.""
Hattie said: ""My mother passed on years ago."""
"Hattie said: ""None of your business.""
Harry said: ""That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother."""
"Hattie said: ""You know the saying, ""your heart is in your left hand.""""
Harry said: ""Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.""
Hattie said: ""I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.""
Harry said: """"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."""""
"Hattie said: ""An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.""
Harry said: ""Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry."""
"Hattie said: ""Is this your house?""
Harry said: ""Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?"""
"Hattie said: ""In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.""
Harry said: ""I already have, my dear."""
"Junior said: ""I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.""
Harry said: ""Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.""
Junior said: ""He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.""
Harry said: ""Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.""
Junior said: ""All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.""
Harry said: ""You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human."""
"Linda said: ""You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.""
Harry said: ""Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at."""
"Harry said: ""Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.""
Linda said: ""I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.""
Harry said: ""I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.""
Linda said: ""What's a toby?""
Harry said: ""You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.""
Linda said: ""I thought you weren't old fashioned.""
Harry said: ""In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X."""
"Harry said: ""Did you have your child at home?""
Linda said: ""No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.""
Harry said: ""Some folks take that natural stuff too far.""
Linda said: ""Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.""
Harry said: ""Country people got so many strange ways,"""
"Suzie said: ""No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.""
Hattie said: ""I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out."""
"Hattie said: ""You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.""
Suzie said: ""I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.""
Hattie said: ""Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children."""
"Suzie said: ""You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.""
Hattie said: ""Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.""
Suzie said: ""I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.""
Hattie said: ""He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.""
Suzie said: ""I can't accuse him just dry long 80.""
Hattie said: ""Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.""
Suzie said: ""What must I do?""
Hattie said: ""If it was left up to me, I would poison him."""
"Junior said: ""We can't really bring another family in here with us.""
Pat said: ""Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.""
Junior said: ""When did you talk to Harry?""
Pat said: ""Don't shout!"""
"Pat said: ""He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.""
Junior said: ""Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.""
Pat said: ""Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls."""
"Pat said: ""Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.""
Junior said: ""I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth."""
"Pat said: ""You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.""
Junior said: ""Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit."""
"Mr. Baker said: ""What are you doing?""
Mrs. Baker said: ""Counting the gray hairs in your head.""
Mr. Baker said: ""Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?""
Mrs. Baker said: ""I was just trying to make conversation.""
Mr. Baker said: ""Where is Skip?""
Mrs. Baker said: ""He is in his pigeon cage.""
Mr. Baker said: ""I'm sorry he got those birds.""
Mrs. Baker said: ""You know the man next door is near death."""
"Suzie said: ""How are you?""
Old John said: ""Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.""
Suzie said: ""It is so considerate of you."""
"Old John said: ""I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.""
Suzie said: ""I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.""
Old John said: ""But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.""
Suzie said: ""I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything."""
"Andy said: ""Wow!  Cool!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Whadda ya think?""
Andy said: ""Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!"""
"Andy said: ""Can we leave this up 'til we move?""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Well, sure, we can leave it up.""
Andy said: ""Yeah!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.""
Andy said: ""Okay."""
"Mrs. Davis said: ""Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!""
Andy said: ""Oh, yeah!"""
"Andy said: ""To infinity and beyond!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?""
Andy said: ""Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!"""
"Andy said: ""Can I bring some toys?""
Mrs. Davis said: ""You can bring ONE toy...""
Andy said: ""Just one?"""
"Andy said: ""Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?""
Mrs. Davis said: ""No, I haven't seen him."""
"Mrs. Davis said: ""Andy!  I'm heading out the door.""
Andy said: ""But Mom, I can't find him!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!""
Andy said: ""Okay..."""
"Andy said: ""I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him."""
"Andy said: ""Can I help pump the gas?""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Sure!  I'll even let you drive."""
"Andy said: ""Yeah?!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Yeah -- when you're sixteen.""
Andy said: ""Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom."""
"Mrs. Davis said: ""Next stop...""
Andy said: ""Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!"""
"Andy said: ""Mom, have you seen Woody?""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Where was the last place you left him?""
Andy said: ""Right here in the van.""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.""
Andy said: ""He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone."""
"Mrs. Davis said: ""I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.""
Andy said: ""But what if we leave them behind?""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow."""
"Mrs. Davis said: ""Everybody say, ""Bye, house.""""
Andy said: ""Bye, house."""
"Andy said: ""Hey!  Wow!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""What?  What is it?""
Andy said: ""Woody!  Buzz!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?""
Andy said: ""Here!  In the car!""
Mrs. Davis said: ""See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them."""
"Andy said: ""Which one can I open first?""
Mrs. Davis said: ""Let's let Molly open one."""
"Woody said: ""Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.""
Bo Peep said: ""I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.""
Woody said: ""Oh, hey - it was nothing.""
Bo Peep said: ""Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?""
Woody said: ""Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I..."""
"Woody said: ""You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.""
Bo Peep said: ""Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife."""
"Woody said: ""Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?""
Bo Peep said: ""I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you."""
"Bo Peep said: ""What are you doing over there?""
Woody said: ""It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!"""
"Woody said: ""We're almost there.""
Bo Peep said: ""Rocky!  The ramp!"""
"Woody said: ""Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.""
Bo Peep said: ""Merry Christmas, Sheriff."""
"Woody said: ""Say, isn't that mistletoe?""
Bo Peep said: ""Mm-hmmmmm."""
"Woody said: ""Hello-o-o...""
Buzz said: ""HO-YAAAHH!!!"""
"Woody said: ""Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.""
Buzz said: ""I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?""
Woody said: ""Well, let's see, we've got double A's --""
Buzz said: ""Watch yourself!!"""
"Woody said: ""Yes.  They're Andy's toys.""
Buzz said: ""Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up."""
"Buzz said: ""Toy?""
Woody said: ""T-O-Y.  Toy.""
Buzz said: ""Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.""
Woody said: ""The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present."""
"Woody said: ""He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --""
Buzz said: ""Excuse me."""
"Buzz said: ""They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.""
Woody said: ""No, you can't.""
Buzz said: ""Yes, I can.""
Woody said: ""You can't!""
Buzz said: ""Can!""
Woody said: ""Can't!  Can't!  Can't!""
Buzz said: ""I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!""
Woody said: ""Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.""
Buzz said: ""All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!"""
"Buzz said: ""Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.""
Woody said: ""That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!"""
"Woody said: ""Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.""
Buzz said: ""What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!"""
"Woody said: ""And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.""
Buzz said: ""Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?"""
"Buzz said: ""Don't even think about it, cowboy!""
Woody said: ""Oh, yeah, tough guy?!"""
"Woody said: ""You actually think you're THE ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!""
Buzz said: ""You're mocking me, aren't you?""
Woody said: ""Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!""
Buzz said: ""Where?"""
"Buzz said: ""What's going on?""
Woody said: ""Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.""
Buzz said: ""I'd better take a look anyway."""
"Buzz said: ""Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?""
Woody said: ""That's why.  Sid.""
Buzz said: ""Sure is a hairy fellah.""
Woody said: ""No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!"""
"Woody said: ""THAT is Sid!""
Buzz said: ""You mean that happy child?"""
"Buzz said: ""I could have stopped him.""
Woody said: ""Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater."""
"Woody said: ""Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!""
Buzz said: ""Trouble?!  Where?!""
Woody said: ""Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!""
Buzz said: ""Then we've no time to lose!!"""
"Woody said: ""Right?  Buddy?""
Buzz said: ""I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.""
Woody said: ""Oh.  Oh, that's good.""
Buzz said: ""But we're not on my planet, are we?""
Woody said: ""No."""
"Buzz said: ""According to my nava-computer, the --""
Woody said: ""Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!""
Buzz said: ""Sheriff, this is no time to panic.""
Woody said: ""This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!""
Buzz said: ""My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --""
Woody said: ""Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --""
Buzz said: ""Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.""
Woody said: ""WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!"""
"Woody said: ""Buzz!  Buzz, come back!""
Buzz said: ""Go away."""
"Buzz said: ""Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?""
Woody said: ""Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.""
Buzz said: ""Well, then let's climb abroad."""
"Woody said: ""No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.""
Buzz said: ""Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit."""
"Woody said: ""Ow!  Watch where you're going!""
Buzz said: ""Sorry."""
"Woody said: ""Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!""
Buzz said: ""You mean it has hyperdrive?""
Woody said: ""Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf."""

Woody said: ""Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death."""
"Woody said: ""I sure hope this isn't permanent.""
Buzz said: ""Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --"""
"Buzz said: ""Woody, we don't know what's out there!""
Woody said: ""I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!"""
"Woody said: ""They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!""
Buzz said: ""Shield your eyes!"""

Buzz said: ""Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!""
Woody said: ""Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!"""
"Buzz said: ""Woody, stop it!!""
Woody said: ""Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!"""
"Buzz said: ""Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.""
Woody said: ""Don't tell me what to do!""
Buzz said: ""Shhh!"""
"Woody said: ""What happened to you?""
Buzz said: ""One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters."""
"Woody said: ""I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.""
Buzz said: ""Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!!"""

Woody said: ""Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.""
Buzz said: ""Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!"""

Buzz said: ""Years of Academy training...wasted!!"""
"Woody said: ""Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.""
Buzz said: ""I can't help.  I can't help anyone.""
Woody said: ""Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.""
Buzz said: ""Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.""
Woody said: ""Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.""
Buzz said: ""No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.""
Woody said: ""Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.""
Buzz said: ""Yeah, right.""
Woody said: ""No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.""
Buzz said: ""But why would Andy want me?""
Woody said: ""Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy."""
"Woody said: ""Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --""
Buzz said: ""Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.""
Woody said: ""Yes Sir!"""
"Buzz said: ""Woody!  It's the moving van.""
Woody said: ""We've got to get out of here...NOW."""
"Woody said: ""Shhhhhhh!""
Buzz said: ""What?!""
Woody said: ""It's ok.  Everything's under control."""
"Woody said: ""Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.""
Buzz said: ""Woody!"""
"Buzz said: ""Hold on, Woody!""
Woody said: ""I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!""

Buzz said: ""We're not aiming for the truck!"""
"Buzz said: ""Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?""
Woody said: ""Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!"""
"Woody said: ""It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.""
Hamm said: ""Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!""

Rex said: ""Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?"""

Arnie said: ""Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?"""
"Arnie said: ""Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?""
Helena said: ""Arnie, this is crazy."""
"Arnie said: ""Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.""
Helena said: ""What is he being charged with?""
Arnie said: ""I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.""
Helena said: ""Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.""
Arnie said: ""That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children."""
"Helena said: ""I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.""
Arnie said: ""Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk..."""
"Helena said: ""If all our assets are frozen and our ""sales force"" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?""
Arnie said: ""You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.""
Helena said: ""How much do I pay him?""
Arnie said: ""I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity."""
"Arnie said: ""This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.""
Helena said: ""Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.""
Arnie said: ""Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.""
Helena said: ""Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?""
Arnie said: ""Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.""
Helena said: ""Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to."""
"Arnie said: ""Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.""
Helena said: ""What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --""
Arnie said: ""Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.""
Helena said: ""Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say."""
"Helena said: ""Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.""
Arnie said: ""I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.""
Helena said: ""I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?"""
"Arnie said: ""That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.""
Helena said: ""I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.""
Arnie said: ""Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.""
Helena said: ""That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us."""
"Arnie said: ""Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.""
Helena said: ""I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with."""
"Arnie said: ""Helena --""
Helena said: ""I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.""
Arnie said: ""I can't do that."""
"Helena said: ""Did you get it?""
Arnie said: ""What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --"""
"Helena said: ""It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?""
Arnie said: ""It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?"""
"Carlos said: ""It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.""
Arnie said: ""Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --"""
"Carlos said: ""Don't bother.""
Arnie said: ""What?""
Carlos said: ""So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?""
Arnie said: ""I was just waiting for the right time.""
Carlos said: ""And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?""
Arnie said: ""I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.""
Carlos said: ""You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.""
Arnie said: ""Carl, that's insane.""
Carlos said: ""So my wife is lying?""
Arnie said: ""Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal."""
"Carlos said: ""Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.""
Arnie said: ""Carl --""
Carlos said: ""Goodbye Arnie."""

Robert said: ""That's frustrating.""
Barbara said: ""It's so frustrating."""
"Robert said: ""I think she's lying.""
Barbara said: ""Me, too.""
Robert said: ""We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.""
Barbara said: ""Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --""
Robert said: ""Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.""
Barbara said: ""Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?""
Robert said: ""This is different.""
Barbara said: ""Why?""
Robert said: ""To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.""
Barbara said: ""I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --""
Robert said: ""Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?""
Barbara said: ""We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences."""
"Robert said: ""How long have you known?""
Barbara said: ""Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --""
Robert said: ""Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.""
Barbara said: ""She asked me not to."""
"Robert said: ""I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.""
Barbara said: ""Does this mean you're going to be gone more?"""
"Barbara said: ""You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.""
Robert said: ""Barbara --""
Barbara said: ""Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.""
Robert said: ""The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.""
Barbara said: ""If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.""
Robert said: ""Look, I'm as worried as you are --""
Barbara said: ""No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.""
Robert said: ""Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too."""
"Barbara said: ""I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.""
Robert said: ""I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.""
Barbara said: ""Oh, it is?""
Robert said: ""Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death."""
"Barbara said: ""Should we bring the police into this?""
Robert said: ""No, not yet."""
"Robert said: ""About the other night, I'm sorry.""
Barbara said: ""Me, too.""
Robert said: ""God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?""
Barbara said: ""I don't know."""
"Barbara said: ""My Leica's gone.""
Robert said: ""So's the video camera.""
Barbara said: ""At least she's alive."""
"Barbara said: ""Where are you going?""
Robert said: ""She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour."""
"Caroline said: ""Did you meet the President?""
Barbara said: ""Honey, your father knows the President."""
"Barbara said: ""Czar for life, just like a real czar.""
Caroline said: ""That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia."""
"Caroline said: ""None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.""
Barbara said: ""Caroline --""
Caroline said: ""Sorry, but I mean, come on."""
"Caroline said: ""Did you tell Dad?""
Barbara said: ""Not yet.""
Caroline said: ""Are you going to?""
Barbara said: ""I don't know.""
Caroline said: ""Is this bad for him?""
Barbara said: ""What do you think?"""
"Caroline said: ""He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?""
Barbara said: ""How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.""
Caroline said: ""He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot."""
"Carl said: ""Hi.""
Helena said: ""Hi.""
Carl said: ""What's up?""
Helena said: ""Just watching you.""
Carl said: ""I got that.  How was your day?"""

Helena said: ""I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something."""
"Carl said: ""How's David?""
Helena said: ""How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.""
Carl said: ""Helena --""
Helena said: ""We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back."""
"Carl said: ""We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --""
Helena said: ""How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.""
Carl said: ""Helena --""
Helena said: ""Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back."""
"Robert said: ""What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say ""please"" or ""thank you.""""
Caroline said: ""What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?""
Robert said: ""Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion."""
"Caroline said: ""What if every country legalized at the same time?""
Robert said: ""Somehow, I don't see that happening."""
"Robert said: ""As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some ""face time"".""
Caroline said: ""Will we get invited to the White House?""
Robert said: ""I don't know.""
Caroline said: ""How long's the job?""

"Robert said: ""Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?""
Caroline said: ""Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo."""
"Robert said: ""Okay, young lady, that's it.""
Caroline said: ""Like I give a fuck."""

Francisco said: ""I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.""
Helena said: ""When will you do it?""
Francisco said: ""I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.""

"Ruiz said: ""Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.""
Gordon said: ""So you pay off our customs officials?""
Ruiz said: ""In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult."""
"Gordon said: ""This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?""
Ruiz said: ""I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.""
Gordon said: ""He hired you.  That was a mistake.""
Ruiz said: ""Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake."""

Gordon said: ""When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons."""

Gordon said: ""That thought makes me feel awful."""
"Ruiz said: ""Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?""
Gordon said: ""You're breaking my heart.""
Ruiz said: ""The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.""
Gordon said: ""So go shower already.""
Ruiz said: ""You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty."""

Helena said: ""Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?""
Marquez said: ""I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.""
Helena said: ""My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.""
Marquez said: ""That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.""

Marquez said: ""I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.""

Marquez said: ""Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors."""

Manolo said: ""They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone."""
"Javier said: ""If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.""
Manolo said: ""She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.""
Javier said: ""Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal."""
"Manolo said: ""Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.""
Javier said: ""The police won't find your car."""
"Manolo said: ""This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.""

Javier said: ""Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?""
Manolo said: ""No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.""

Javier said: ""An informant.""
Salazar said: ""What is the name of your informant?""
Javier said: ""It was an anonymous tip."""

Javier said: ""If I can.""
Salazar said: ""I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.""
Javier said: ""What is it you want me to do?""
Salazar said: ""A small thing.  Nothing really."""
"Javier said: ""Does this offer include my partner?""
Salazar said: ""Only if he can be trusted.""
Javier said: ""He'll do what I say."""
"Salazar said: ""I'm curious how you did this with such economy.""
Javier said: ""Everybody has a weakness."""
"Salazar said: ""You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.""
Javier said: ""But will he be house-trained?""
Salazar said: ""When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall."""
"Robert said: ""The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?""
Javier said: ""I'm aware of that.""
Robert said: ""So what's it doing in Tijuana?"""
"Robert said: ""Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?""
Javier said: ""It could mean that, yes.""
Robert said: ""That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?""
Javier said: ""It's possible.""
Robert said: ""Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?"""
"Michael said: ""My work keeps me young.""

Michael said: ""The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.""
Robert said: ""Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.""
Michael said: ""We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.""
Robert said: ""Noriega is a criminal.""
Michael said: ""Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.""
Robert said: ""Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.""
Michael said: ""I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.""
Robert said: ""If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments."""
"Official said: ""The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.""
Robert said: ""Any idea how much?""
Official said: ""I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.""
Robert said: ""What do you look for?""
Official said: ""We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.""
Robert said: ""Any way we can do it better?""
Official said: ""Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?""
Robert said: ""That triple the amount of stuff is going through.""
Official said: ""Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?"""

Robert said: ""You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she."""

Seth said: ""Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?"""

Robert said: ""I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.""
Salazar said: ""That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods."""
"Robert said: ""You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.""
Salazar said: ""Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.""
Robert said: ""Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.""
Salazar said: ""Yes, I hope so as well.""
Robert said: ""Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?""
Salazar said: ""Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about."""
"Sheridan said: ""I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person.

I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.""
Robert said: ""Like you protected Landry?""
Sheridan said: ""I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for."""

Robert said: ""I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?""
Special-Agent-In-Charge said: ""I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.

People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important.

Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }""
Renton said: ""So?""
Sick Boy said: ""So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.""
Renton said: ""So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?"""
"Renton said: ""What was your price?""
Sick Boy said: ""Four Grand.""
Renton said: ""But you don't have the money?""
Sick Boy said: ""We're two thousand short.""
Renton said: ""That's tough.""
Sick Boy said: ""Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.""
Renton said: ""Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds."""
"Renton said: ""From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.""
Swanney said: ""Are you serious?""
Renton said: ""Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.""
Swanney said: ""Well, it's up to you.""
Renton said: ""I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.""
Swanney said: ""Sure, sure. I've heard it before.""
Renton said: ""The Sick Boy method.""
Swanney said: ""Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.""
Renton said: ""He's always been lacking in moral fibre.""
Swanney said: ""He knows a lot about Sean Connery.""
Renton said: ""That's hardly a substitute.""
Swanney said: ""you'll need one more hit.""
Renton said: ""No, I don't think so.""
Swanney said: ""To see you through the night that lies ahead."""
"Renton said: ""What's on the menu this evening?""
Swanney said: ""Your favourite dish.""
Renton said: ""Excellent.""
Swanney said: ""Your usual table, sir?""
Renton said: ""Why, thank you."""
"Swanney said: ""And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?""
Renton said: ""Stick it on my tab.""
Swanney said: ""Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.""
Renton said: ""In that case --"""
"Renton said: ""No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.""
Swanney said: ""As you wish."""
"Renton said: ""Great.""
Swanney said: ""And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.""
Renton said: ""Sure.""
Swanney said: ""The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.""
Renton said: ""Sounds great, Swanney.""
Swanney said: ""Yeah.""
Renton said: ""You'll have to send us a postcard.""
Swanney said: ""Sure will, pal, sure will."""

Sick Boy said: ""If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.""
Tommy said: ""Such as?""
Sick Boy said: ""Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?"""
"Tommy said: ""There.""
Sick Boy said: ""Are you serious?"""

Spud said: ""No joy yet.""
Tommy said: ""How long is it?""

Tommy said: ""Six weeks!""

Tommy said: ""Where did she come up with that?""
Spud said: ""She read it in Cosmopolitan.""
Tommy said: ""Six weeks and no sex?""
Spud said: ""I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you."""
"Tommy said: ""Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.""
Spud said: ""That's fair enough.""
Tommy said: ""Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.""
Spud said: ""Went ballistic?""
Tommy said: ""Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'""
Spud said: ""So what's it going to be?""
Tommy said: ""Well, I've paid for the ticket."""

Spud said: ""What?""
Tommy said: ""A walk.""
Spud said: ""But where?"""

Spud said: ""I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal."""

Spud said: ""I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.""
Woman said: ""Homeless people?""
Spud said: ""No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --""
Woman said: ""Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?""
Spud said: ""No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview.

Sulu said: ""All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time."""

Sybok said: ""Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?"""
"Chekov'S Image said: ""You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.""
Sybok said: ""Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.""
Chekov'S Image said: ""We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances."""

Chekov'S Image said: ""I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.""

Commanders Image said: ""Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?"""

Commanders Image said: ""I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.""
Kirk said: ""On ""The Planet Of Galactic Peace?""""
Commanders Image said: ""The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages."""
"Commanders Image said: ""The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...""
Kirk said: ""With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.""
Commanders Image said: ""Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.""
Kirk said: ""Oh, please.""
Commanders Image said: ""Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.""
Kirk said: ""Have the Klingons responded?""
Commanders Image said: ""No, but you can bet they will.""

J'Onn said: ""I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?""
Rider said: ""Join my quest.""
J'Onn said: ""What is it you seek?""
Rider said: ""What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.""
J'Onn said: ""A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.""
Rider said: ""Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.""
J'Onn said: ""But how?""
Rider said: ""Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know."""
"Kirk said: ""You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?""
Scotty said: ""I think you gave me too much time, Captain.""
Kirk said: ""Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.""
Scotty said: ""Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job..."""
"Scotty said: ""Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.""
Kirk said: ""I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott."""
"Scotty said: ""Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.""
Kirk said: ""Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way."""
"Scotty said: ""Captain, we can't trust anyone now.""
Kirk said: ""If we could send a distress signal..."""
"Kirk said: ""Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?""
Scotty said: ""Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.""
Kirk said: ""Mr. Scott, you're amazing."""
"Scotty said: ""She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.""
Kirk said: ""Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!"""

Kirk said: ""Put it on the screen."""

Uhura said: ""Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.""
Kirk said: ""Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.""

Spock said: ""I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me."""
"Spock said: ""I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.""
Kirk said: ""I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...""
Spock said: ""And that is?""
Kirk said: ""Because it's there.""
Spock said: ""Ah, Captain?""
Kirk said: ""MM.?""
Spock said: ""I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation."""
"Kirk said: ""On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?""
Spock said: ""I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods."""
"Spock said: ""Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.""
Kirk said: ""Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one..."""
"Kirk said: ""Oh, God""
Spock said: ""Perhaps ""because it is there"" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain."""
"Kirk said: ""Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.""
Spock said: ""I don't understand.""
Kirk said: ""I've always known... I'll die alone."""
"Kirk said: ""What are you doing?""
Spock said: ""I am preparing to toast a marsh melon."""
"Spock said: ""Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.""
Kirk said: ""That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?"""

Spock said: ""Are we leaving, Captain?"""
"Kirk said: """"Row, row, row your boat..."" I love ""Row...""  Do - do you know ""Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?""""
Spock said: ""That song did not come up in my research, Captain.""
Kirk said: ""The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, ""Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.."" The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please."""
"Kirk said: ""Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?""
Spock said: ""I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words."""
"Spock said: ""Captain?""
Kirk said: ""Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.""
Spock said: ""Jim.""
Kirk said: ""Yes, Spock?""
Spock said: ""Life is not a dream.""
Kirk said: ""Go to sleep, Spock.""
Spock said: ""Yes, Captain.""
Kirk said: ""Goodnight, Bones."""
"Kirk said: ""Goodnight, Spock.""
Spock said: ""Goodnight, Doctor."""
"Kirk said: ""I could use a shower.""
Spock said: ""Yes."""
"Kirk said: ""Not General Korrd.""
Spock said: ""The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.""
Kirk said: ""General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd."""
"Kirk said: ""What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.""
Spock said: ""Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have."""
"Kirk said: ""Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?""
Spock said: ""I cannot be certain.""
Kirk said: ""But he does seem familiar?""
Spock said: ""He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth."""
"Spock said: ""I do not often think of the past.""
Kirk said: ""Who is it he reminds you of?""
Spock said: ""There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.""
Kirk said: ""What do you mean?""
Spock said: ""The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief."""
"Spock said: ""He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.""
Kirk said: ""Why?""
Spock said: ""He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic."""
"Spock said: ""When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.""
Kirk said: ""Fascinating."""
"Spock said: ""Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.""
Kirk said: ""Damn.  Let's go."""
"Spock said: ""Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.""
Kirk said: ""That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.""
Spock said: ""To land any closer would risk detection.""
Kirk said: ""Mr. Sulu. Execute."""
"Spock said: ""At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.""
Kirk said: ""We don't have 1.2 hours."""
"Kirk said: ""Spock.""
Spock said: ""Yes, Captain?""
Kirk said: ""Be one with the horse.""
Spock said: ""Yes, Captain."""
"Spock said: ""Exactly 15.5 seconds.""
Kirk said: ""An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him."""
"Spock said: ""You must allow us to act.""
Kirk said: ""Let me do something."""
"Kirk said: ""Damnit, Spock. God damnit!""
Spock said: ""Captain, what have I done -""
Kirk said: ""What you have done is betray every man on this ship.""
Spock said: ""Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.""
Kirk said: ""Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!""
Spock said: ""If you think it would help."""
"Kirk said: ""You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.""
Spock said: ""If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.""
Kirk said: ""I ordered you to defend this ship.""
Spock said: ""You ordered me to kill my brother.""
Kirk said: ""Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...""
Spock said: ""No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek."""
"Kirk said: ""You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!""
Spock said: ""I did not.""
Kirk said: ""You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.""
Spock said: ""Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.""
Kirk said: ""There, you see? See?""
Spock said: ""I have a half brother.""
Kirk said: ""I gotta sit down."""
"Spock said: ""Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.""
Kirk said: ""Why didn't you tell me this before?""
Spock said: ""I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.""
Kirk said: ""He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's..."""
"Kirk said: ""There's got to be a way out of this place.""
Spock said: ""This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.""
Kirk said: ""How do you know?""
Spock said: ""The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.""
Kirk said: ""This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?""
Spock said: ""He did have pointed ears."""
"Spock said: ""Is it possible?""
Kirk said: ""Is what possible?""
Spock said: ""That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan."""
"Spock said: ""There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.""
Kirk said: ""But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.""
Spock said: ""Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.""
Kirk said: ""Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.""
Spock said: ""I am here, Captain.""

Spock said: ""Welcome aboard, Captain."""

Spock said: ""Not possible. You were never alone."""

Spock said: ""I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.""
Kirk said: ""Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back."""

"Sybok said: ""No! No reply. Remain on course.""
Kirk said: ""Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-"""
"Sybok said: ""What are you doing?""
Kirk said: ""In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually."""
"Sybok said: ""We must change our course at once.""
Kirk said: ""I'll take you to the bridge."""
"Sybok said: ""I trust your message was received?""
Kirk said: ""You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.""
Sybok said: ""What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?""
Kirk said: ""I'm afraid of nothing."""
"Sybok said: ""Sha Ka Ree. ""The Scource."" ""Heaven."" ""Eden."" call it ""Qui'Tu."" To the Romulans, it's ""Vorta Vor."" The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.""

Scotty said: ""Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.""
Uhura said: ""Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.""
Scotty said: ""He's not?""
Uhura said: ""No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express."""

"Alan said: ""You did break in.""
Flynn said: ""Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...""
Alan said: ""Are you embezzling?""
Flynn said: """"Embezzling"" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.""
Alan said: ""I don't get it.""
Flynn said: ""You haven't told him?"""
"Flynn said: ""Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.""
Alan said: ""You invented Space Paranoids?""
Flynn said: ""Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has ""invented"" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?""
Alan said: ""Senior exec.""
Flynn said: ""Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.""
Alan said: ""I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.""
Flynn said: ""Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it."""
"Alan said: ""Dillinger?""
Flynn said: ""Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high.."""

Alan said: ""Hi, Flynn."""
"Flynn said: ""My dinner.""
Alan said: ""I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.""
Flynn said: ""Want one?""
Alan said: ""Uh... got any cinnamon?"""
"Alan said: ""Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.""
Flynn said: ""I know, I met him."""
"Alan said: ""Your old files -- ?""
Flynn said: ""And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.""
Alan said: ""Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods..."""
"Alan said: ""Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?""
Flynn said: ""Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life..."""
"Lora said: ""How's it going upstairs?""
Alan said: ""Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system."""
"Lora said: ""Did you say Group 7 access?""
Alan said: ""Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set""
Lora said: ""Did he say why?""
Alan said: ""Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?""
Lora said: ""Flynn had Group 7 access.""
Alan said: ""Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.""
Lora said: ""Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.""
Alan said: ""Okay, okay...""
Lora said: ""I want to go to his place.""
Alan said: ""You call that getting over it?""

Gibbs said: ""Hello, Alan.""
Alan said: ""Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun."""
"Gibbs said: ""Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.""
Alan said: ""Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?""
Gibbs said: ""Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!"""
"Alan said: ""Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.""
Gibbs said: ""Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...""
Alan said: ""They'll start to soon enough.""
Gibbs said: ""Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow."""
"Dillinger said: ""Come on in...""
Alan said: ""Alan. Alan Bailey.""
Dillinger said: ""Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?"""
"Alan said: ""Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.""
Dillinger said: ""oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?""
Alan said: ""Yeah...?""
Dillinger said: ""We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.""
Alan said: ""I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.""
Dillinger said: ""No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?""
Alan said: ""It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.""
Dillinger said: ""Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?""
Alan said: ""No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.""
Dillinger said: ""Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.""
Alan said: ""Ok"""
"Flynn said: ""What do you mean, ""'yes""?""
Bit said: ""Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes."""

Bit said: ""Not a chance."""
"Bit said: ""You said it.""
Flynn said: ""So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?"""
"Bit said: ""Yes!""
Flynn said: ""Let's get outta here."""
"Dillinger said: ""No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?""
Mcp said: ""It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.""
Dillinger said: ""Flynn?""
Mcp said: ""Yes.  It felt like Flynn.""
Dillinger said: ""He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?""
Mcp said: ""I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...""
Dillinger said: ""Meanwhile, he might find it.""
Mcp said: ""I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.""
Dillinger said: ""I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.""
Mcp said: ""There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.""
Dillinger said: ""Cute.""
Mcp said: ""End of line."""
"Mcp said: ""Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.""
Dillinger said: ""I'm sorry -""
Mcp said: ""I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?""
Dillinger said: ""It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...""
Mcp said: ""And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...""
Dillinger said: ""The Pentagon?""
Mcp said: ""It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.""
Dillinger said: ""Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.""
Mcp said: ""I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.""
Dillinger said: ""What do you want with the Pentagon?""
Mcp said: ""The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.""
Dillinger said: ""If you think -""
Mcp said: ""You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?""
Dillinger said: ""You wouldn't dare.""
Mcp said: ""So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for."""
"Gibbs said: ""Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -""
Dillinger said: ""Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --""
Gibbs said: ""That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --""
Dillinger said: ""The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --""
Gibbs said: ""User requests are what computers are for.""
Dillinger said: ""Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --"""
"Gibbs said: ""Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...""
Dillinger said: ""It can be arranged..."""
"Gibbs said: ""That was uncalled-for.""
Dillinger said: ""I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?""
Gibbs said: ""Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on."""

Dumont said: ""Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you"""
"Tron said: ""Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.""
Dumont said: ""Hah.""

Tron said: ""Then...""
Flynn said: ""Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.""

Flynn said: ""I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.""

Simon said: ""It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.""
Harry said: ""So what's your angle?""
Simon said: ""Sorry.  Trade secret.""
Harry said: ""Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me."""
"Simon said: ""Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.""
Harry said: ""So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.""
Simon said: ""Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.""
Harry said: ""Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?""
Simon said: ""Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.""
Harry said: ""Use 'em and lose 'em.""
Simon said: ""Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.""
Harry said: ""What about the husbands?""
Simon said: ""Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?""
Harry said: ""Those idiots."""
"Harry said: ""You working on someone right now?""
Simon said: ""I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great."""
"Harry said: ""What does she do?""
Simon said: ""Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk."""
"Harry said: ""But with you, she gets to be hot, right?""
Simon said: ""Red hot.  Her thighs steam."""
"Harry said: ""Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?""
Simon said: ""Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!"""
"Simon said: ""See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?""
Harry said: ""Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?"""
"Simon said: ""Yeeaoowww!!""
Harry said: ""You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?""
Simon said: ""Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--"""
"Harry said: ""Beat it.""
Simon said: ""No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me."""
"Voice said: ""I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?""
Helen said: ""Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.""
Voice said: ""Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?""
Helen said: ""He said he was an American agent."""
"Helen said: ""What?""
Voice said: ""Get going!""
Helen said: ""Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye."""
"Voice said: ""Boris and Doris?""
Helen said: ""Go ahead."""
"Juno said: ""Who's your little friend?""
Helen said: ""I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?""
Juno said: ""So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?"""
"Helen said: ""Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.""
Juno said: ""No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.""
Helen said: ""No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--"""
"Helen said: ""What's going on, Harry?""
Juno said: ""Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist."""
"Juno said: ""Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.""
Helen said: ""Something you obviously have a hard time doing!""
Juno said: ""Hold that thought."""
"Juno said: ""Like one?""
Helen said: ""Fuck you."""
"Helen said: ""Hello?""
Simon said: ""Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?""
Helen said: ""Yes.  Go ahead."""
"Helen said: ""Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?""
Simon said: ""The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you."""
"Simon said: ""Are you sure you weren't followed?""
Helen said: ""I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.""
Simon said: ""Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.""
Helen said: ""I understand.""
Simon said: ""It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust."""
"Helen said: ""Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?""
Simon said: ""Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.""
Helen said: ""Worse than Cairo?							*""
Simon said: ""Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this."""
"Simon said: ""Did you read the papers yesterday?""
Helen said: ""Yes.""
Simon said: ""Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot..."""
"Helen said: ""That was you?!""
Simon said: ""You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this."""
"Helen said: ""Tell me what happened?""
Simon said: ""I'm sorry, I can't.""
Helen said: ""You can trust me completely.""
Simon said: ""I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.""
Helen said: ""Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.""
Simon said: ""It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins."""
"Helen said: ""Were they trying to kill you?					*""
Simon said: ""Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.""
Helen said: ""And you chased one?""
Simon said: ""Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  ."""
"Helen said: ""What is it you want me to do?""
Simon said: ""Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.""
Helen said: ""You'll call me then?""
Simon said: ""Yes.  Now go."""
"Helen said: ""What's happened?""
Simon said: ""It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*"""
"Simon said: ""To our assignment.""
Helen said: ""What is it you need me to do?""
Simon said: ""Helen, I want you to be my wife.""
Helen said: ""I'm married!""
Simon said: ""Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.""
Helen said: ""We're going to Paris?""
Simon said: ""Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.""
Helen said: ""I don't know.  I have to think...""
Simon said: ""Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable."""
"Simon said: ""You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.""
Helen said: ""It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--""
Simon said: ""Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role."""
"Simon said: ""Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?""
Helen said: ""Helen.""
Simon said: ""You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.""
Helen said: ""I just glances inside."""
"Juno said: ""It's a good thing you pay me well.""
Malik said: ""Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--""
Juno said: ""No.  He checked out okay--"""
"Juno said: ""What do you want me to do?""
Malik said: ""Find out who this Renquist it.""
Juno said: ""How?""
Malik said: ""Use the gifts that Allah has given you."""
"Malik said: ""Who is this woman?""
Juno said: ""His wife.""
Malik said: ""His wife?  Good.  Bring them."""
"Alabama said: ""Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.""
Dick said: ""Hello, Alabama.""
Alabama said: ""I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too."""
"Alabama said: ""He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.""
Dick said: ""Wait a minute -"""
"Alabama said: ""Did you get the letter?""
Dick said: ""What letter?""
Alabama said: ""What letter?"""
"Alabama said: ""Gotten your mail yet?""
Dick said: ""Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.""
Alabama said: ""Yes."""
"Dick said: ""Not yet.""
Alabama said: ""Nope."""
"Dick said: ""Let me speak to Clarence.""
Alabama said: ""He wants to speak with you."""
"Alabama said: ""You're gonna be on ""T.J. Hooker""?""
Dick said: ""Knock wood."""
"Alabama said: ""That was so good I am gonna have another.""
Dick said: ""You can't have just one."""
"Dick said: ""Holy Mary, Mother of God.""
Alabama said: ""This is great, we got cable."""
"Dick said: ""You got that playing basketball?""
Alabama said: ""Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face."""
"Alabama said: ""I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.""
Clarence said: ""Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?"""
"Clarence said: ""This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.""
Alabama said: ""Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy."""
"Alabama said: ""The forager's back.""
Clarence said: ""Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.""
Alabama said: ""I didn't get any chicken.""
Clarence said: ""How come?""
Alabama said: ""It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open."""
"Alabama said: ""Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.""
Clarence said: ""What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?""
Alabama said: ""Oh, hush up."""
"Clarence said: ""Tell him we gotta go.""
Alabama said: ""Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it."""
"Clarence said: ""Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.""
Alabama said: ""Don't eat anything."""
"Clarence said: ""The letter I sent.""
Alabama said: ""The letter he sent."""
"Clarence said: ""Has he looked through it yet?""
Alabama said: ""Ya looked through it?"""
"Clarence said: ""Tell him to look through it.""
Alabama said: ""Get it."""
"Clarence said: ""No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.""
Alabama said: ""He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over."""
"Alabama said: ""Bye-bye.""
Clarence said: ""Now hang up."""
"Alabama said: ""... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, ""Get her in here."". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.""
Clarence said: ""And here we are."""
"Alabama said: ""Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?""
Clarence said: ""Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.""
Alabama said: ""I'm the clumsiest person in the world.""
Clarence said: ""It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.""
Alabama said: ""What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick."""
"Clarence said: ""Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.""
Alabama said: ""The oriental.""
Clarence said: ""The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.""
Alabama said: ""Want some Goobers?""
Clarence said: ""Thanks a lot.""
Alabama said: ""I thought Sonny was the good guy.""
Clarence said: ""He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up."""
"Alabama said: ""Great movie. Action-packed!""
Clarence said: ""Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?""
Alabama said: ""Sonny kicks ass.""
Clarence said: ""You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the ""Streetfighter"". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.""
Alabama said: ""If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.""
Clarence said: ""My name is Clarence, and what is yours?""
Alabama said: ""Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.""
Clarence said: ""Is that your real name? Really?""
Alabama said: ""That's my real name, really. I got proof. See."""
"Clarence said: ""Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.""
Alabama said: ""I took a cab.""
Clarence said: ""You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?""
Alabama said: ""Sure. Why not?""
Clarence said: ""Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.""
Alabama said: ""What time is it?""
Clarence said: ""'Bout twelve.""
Alabama said: ""I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?""
Clarence said: ""No. Not particularly.  How come?""
Alabama said: ""Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?""
Clarence said: ""I love to get pie after a movie.""
Alabama said: ""Would you like to get some pie?""
Clarence said: ""I'd love some pie."""
"Clarence said: ""Well, enough about the King. How about you?""
Alabama said: ""How 'bout me what?""
Clarence said: ""Tell me about yourself.""
Alabama said: ""There's nothing to tell.""
Clarence said: ""C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?""
Alabama said: ""What do you want to know?""
Clarence said: ""Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?"""
"Alabama said: ""Ask me them again. One by one.""
Clarence said: ""What do you do?""
Alabama said: ""I don't remember.""
Clarence said: ""Where are you from.""
Alabama said: ""Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.""
Clarence said: ""What's your favorite color?""
Alabama said: ""I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.""
Clarence said: ""What's your favorite movie star?""
Alabama said: ""Burt Reynolds.""
Clarence said: ""Would you like a bite of my pie?""
Alabama said: ""Yes, I would."""
"Clarence said: ""Like it?""
Alabama said: ""Very much. Now, where were we?""
Clarence said: ""What kinda music do you like?""
Alabama said: ""Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like ""He's a Rebel"".""
Clarence said: ""What are your turn-ons?""
Alabama said: ""Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.""
Clarence said: ""Turn-offs?""
Alabama said: ""I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.""
Clarence said: ""Do you have a fella?"""
"Alabama said: ""I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.""
Clarence said: ""What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?""
Alabama said: ""Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.""
Clarence said: ""And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?""
Alabama said: ""Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you."""
"Alabama said: ""Wow. What a swell place to work.""
Clarence said: ""Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.""
Alabama said: ""How long have you worked here?""
Clarence said: ""Almost four years.""
Alabama said: ""That's a long time.""
Clarence said: ""I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.""
Alabama said: ""Do you get paid a lot?""
Clarence said: ""That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what ""Spiderman"" number one looks like?""
Alabama said: ""You bet. How much is that worth?"""
"Clarence said: ""Four hundred bucks.""
Alabama said: ""I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.""
Clarence said: ""Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" Lunch boxes. ""Green Hornet"" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here."""
"Alabama said: ""What's that?""
Clarence said: ""That's a ""Rookies"" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in ""The Black Hole""? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine."""
"Alabama said: ""God, Spiderman looks different.""
Clarence said: ""He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time."""
"Alabama said: ""Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?""
Clarence said: ""Five."""
"Alabama said: ""Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.""
Clarence said: ""I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up."""
"Clarence said: ""You know when you sat behind me?""
Alabama said: ""At the movies?""
Clarence said: ""Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.""
Alabama said: ""What would make you think that?""
Clarence said: ""I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.""
Alabama said: ""You're not stupid. Just wrong."""
"Alabama said: ""I love Janis.""
Clarence said: ""You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.""
Alabama said: ""She OD'd, didn't she?""
Clarence said: ""Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.""
Alabama said: ""You mean she got a bad batch?""
Clarence said: ""That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, ""Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it."" So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.""
Alabama said: ""So he really loved her?""
Clarence said: ""Uh-huh."""
"Clarence said: ""What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?""
Alabama said: ""You didn't do nothing.""
Clarence said: ""Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?""
Alabama said: ""Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.""
Clarence said: ""What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.""
Alabama said: ""I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl."""
"Clarence said: ""You're a whore?""
Alabama said: ""I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.""
Clarence said: """"Heroes For Sale""?""
Alabama said: ""Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.""
Clarence said: ""Who?""
Alabama said: ""I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.""
Clarence said: ""That dazzling imagination.""
Alabama said: ""It's over on the TV. All it says is: ""Dear Clarence."" I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, ""Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself.""""
Clarence said: ""Who and what is a Drexl?""
Alabama said: ""My pimp.""
Clarence said: ""You have a pimp?""
Alabama said: ""Uh-huh.""
Clarence said: ""A real live pimp?""
Alabama said: ""Uh-huh.""
Clarence said: ""Is he black?""
Alabama said: ""He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.""
Clarence said: ""Is he nice?""
Alabama said: ""Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.""
Clarence said: ""What did he do to Arlene?""
Alabama said: ""Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.""
Clarence said: ""This motherfucker sounds charming!"""
"Clarence said: ""Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?""
Alabama said: ""At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in ""Dressed to Kill"". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.""
Clarence said: ""Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?""
Alabama said: ""What?""
Clarence said: ""Will you be my wife?"""
"Alabama said: ""Yes.""
Clarence said: ""You will?""
Alabama said: ""You better not be fucking teasing me.""
Clarence said: ""You better not be fuckin' teasin' me."""
"Clarence said: ""Did ya ever see ""The Chinese Professionals""?""
Alabama said: ""I don't believe so.""
Clarence said: ""Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer."""
"Alabama said: ""I do.""
Clarence said: ""Thank you."""
"Clarence said: ""Hello, Mrs. Worley.""
Alabama said: ""How do you do, Mr. Worley?""
Clarence said: ""Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.""
Alabama said: ""Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?""
Clarence said: ""Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.""
Alabama said: ""Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?"""
"Alabama said: ""No no no no no no no no no...""
Clarence said: ""Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes..."""
"Alabama said: ""Where you goin', honey?""
Clarence said: ""I just gotta get somethin'."""
"Clarence said: ""Sweetheart, write down your former address.""
Alabama said: ""What?""
Clarence said: ""Write down Drexl's address.""
Alabama said: ""Why?""
Clarence said: ""So I can go over there and pick up your things.""
Alabama said: ""No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there."""
"Clarence said: ""Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?""
Alabama said: ""You don't know him -""
Clarence said: ""You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address."""
"Alabama said: ""Was it him or you?""
Clarence said: ""Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, ""If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it."" I could. So I did.""
Alabama said: ""Is this a joke?""
Clarence said: ""No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good."""
"Alabama said: ""I think what you did was...""
Clarence said: ""What?""
Alabama said: ""I think what you did...""
Clarence said: ""What?""
Alabama said: ""... was so romantic."""
"Clarence said: ""Do you want some wine, sweetheart?""
Alabama said: ""Nope. I'm not really a wine gal."""
"Alabama said: ""You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?""
Clarence said: ""Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.""
Alabama said: ""I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.""
Clarence said: ""You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.""
Alabama said: ""I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms."""
"Clarence said: ""Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.""
Alabama said: ""Really?""
Clarence said: ""With a vengeance, I hated them.""
Alabama said: ""How come?""
Clarence said: ""I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.""
Alabama said: ""What?""
Clarence said: ""Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun."""
"Clarence said: ""But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.""
Alabama said: ""You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.""
Clarence said: ""I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?""
Alabama said: ""Cancoon.""
Clarence said: ""Why Cancoon?""
Alabama said: ""It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. ""Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon"". Don't 'cha think?""
Clarence said: ""But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing."""
"Alabama said: ""I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.""
Clarence said: ""It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside."""
"Alabama said: ""It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.""
Clarence said: ""That rhymes."""
"Big D said: ""What the fuck are you talkin' about?""
Drexl said: ""Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.""
Big D said: ""Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.""
Drexl said: ""I heard that."""
"Big D said: ""Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.""
Drexl said: ""Heard that."""
"Drexl said: ""Damn skippy. He like it, too.""
Big D said: ""Me thinketh he doth protest too much."""
"Big D said: ""Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -""
Drexl said: ""Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do."""
"Big D said: ""I'm hip.""
Drexl said: ""In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun."""
"Floyd said: ""Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?""
Big D said: ""Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang."""
"Floyd said: ""Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.""
Big D said: ""So you do eat pussy!""
Floyd said: ""Naw naw!""
Big D said: ""You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it."""
"Floyd said: ""Ain't no man have to eat pussy!""
Big D said: ""Take that shit somewhere else."""
"Clarence said: ""What?""
Elvis said: ""Can you live with it?""
Clarence said: ""Live with what?""
Elvis said: ""With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?""
Clarence said: ""Yeah.""
Elvis said: ""You wanna get unhaunted?""
Clarence said: ""Yeah.""
Elvis said: ""Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.""
Clarence said: ""I can't believe what you're tellin' me.""
Elvis said: ""I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.""
Clarence said: ""You'd really do that?""
Elvis said: ""He don't got no right to live.""
Clarence said: ""Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.""
Elvis said: ""I don't blame you.""
Clarence said: ""If I thought I could get away with it -""
Elvis said: ""Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it."""
"Elvis said: ""Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.""
Clarence said: ""I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.""
Elvis said: ""All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.""
Clarence said: ""Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.""
Elvis said: ""Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: ""I'll take that gun"", ""You'll have to"".""
Clarence said: ""That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that."""
"Clarence said: ""How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?""
Elvis said: ""Are you kiddin'? He loves you.""
Clarence said: ""You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?""
Elvis said: ""You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.""
Clarence said: ""I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"".""
Elvis said: ""That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that."""
"Drexl said: ""Where the fuck is that bitch?""
Clarence said: ""She's with me.""
Drexl said: ""Who the fuck are you?""
Clarence said: ""I'm her husband.""
Drexl said: ""Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in."""
"Drexl said: ""Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.""
Clarence said: ""No thanks.""
Drexl said: ""No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, ""This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV."" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties."""
"Clarence said: ""Wannabee nigger...""
Drexl said: ""Fuck you! My mother was Apache."""
"Dick said: ""Clarence?""
Clarence said: ""You got it.""
Dick said: ""It's great to hear from you.""
Clarence said: ""Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.""
Dick said: ""You comin' to L.A.? When?""
Clarence said: ""Tomorrow.""
Dick said: ""What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?"""
"Clarence said: ""Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.""
Dick said: ""Get the fuck outta here!""
Clarence said: ""I'm a married man.""
Dick said: ""Get the fuck outta here!""
Clarence said: ""Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?"""
"Dick said: ""What?""
Clarence said: ""Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow."""
"Dick said: ""Alabama, could you tell Clar -""
Clarence said: ""Ask him if he got the letter."""
"Dick said: ""Clarence sent a letter?""
Clarence said: ""Has he gotten his mail today?"""
"Dick said: ""Money problems?""
Clarence said: ""Now tell him goodbye."""
"Dick said: ""That's a pretty amazing story.""
Clarence said: ""Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?""
Dick said: ""Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.""
Clarence said: ""You goin' out?""
Dick said: ""Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.""
Clarence said: ""Good for you.""
Dick said: ""What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for ""T.J. Hooker"" the other day."""
"Dick said: ""... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.""
Clarence said: ""Did you meet Captain Kirk?""
Dick said: ""You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope."""
"Dick said: ""How much of that letter was on the up and up?""
Clarence said: ""Every word of it."""
"Dick said: ""You're really in love, aren't you?""
Clarence said: ""For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?"""
"Dick said: ""This shit can't be real.""
Clarence said: ""It'll get ya high."""
"Dick said: ""It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!""
Clarence said: ""I certainly hope so.""
Dick said: ""You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!""
Clarence said: ""I know.""
Dick said: ""Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?""
Clarence said: ""Tell me.""
Dick said: ""I don't know! A fuckin' lot!"""
"Dick said: ""This is Drexl's coke?""
Clarence said: ""Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?""
Dick said: ""Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine."""
"Clarence said: ""But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.""
Dick said: ""Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -""
Clarence said: ""No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.""
Dick said: ""Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?""
Clarence said: ""I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?""
Dick said: ""It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.""
Clarence said: ""Is he big league?""
Dick said: ""He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.""
Clarence said: ""What'd'ya tell 'em?""
Dick said: ""Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.""
Clarence said: ""What's this acting class guy's name?""
Dick said: ""Elliot.""
Clarence said: ""Elliot what?""
Dick said: ""Elliot Blitzer.""
Clarence said: ""OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.""
Dick said: ""Where?""
Clarence said: ""The zoo.""
Clarence said: ""The zoo.  What are you waiting for?""
Dick said: ""Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?""
Clarence said: ""What's to think about?""
Dick said: ""Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.""
Clarence said: ""Two guys.""
Dick said: ""Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.""
Clarence said: ""Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'."""
"Dick said: ""Clarence...""
Clarence said: ""Let me handle this."""
"Dick said: ""Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.""
Clarence said: ""I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?"""
"Dick said: ""I got the part on ""T.J. Hooker"".""
Clarence said: ""No shit? Dick, that's great!"""
"Dick said: ""They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.""
Clarence said: ""Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late."""
"Dick said: ""Clarence.""
Clarence said: ""Yeah?""
Dick said: ""Um, nothing, let's go?"""
"Dick said: ""What the fuck did you bring that for.""
Clarence said: ""In case.""
Dick said: ""In case of what?""
Clarence said: ""In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?""
Dick said: ""Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -""
Clarence said: ""I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it."""
"Dick said: ""Do you really mean it?""
Clarence said: ""No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?"""
"Dick said: ""Now's a helluva time to play ""what if"".""
Clarence said: ""This is our last chance to play ""what if"". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught."""
"Dick said: ""Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.""
Clarence said: ""Yeah, let's just get outta here."""
"Dick said: ""No. But thanks.""
Clarence said: ""No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick."""
"Lucy said: ""I'd fuck Elvis.""
Clarence said: ""Really?""
Lucy said: ""When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.""
Clarence said: ""I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?"""
"Clarence said: ""Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?""
Lucy said: ""How 'bout me what?""
Clarence said: ""How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?""
Lucy said: ""What are we gonna see?""
Clarence said: ""A Donny Chiba triple feature. ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the Streetfighter"", and ""Sister Streetfighter"".""
Lucy said: ""Who's Sonny Chiba?""
Clarence said: ""He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.""
Lucy said: ""You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?""
Clarence said: ""Three kung fu movies."""
"Elliot said: ""So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -""
Clarence said: ""Want an animal cracker?""
Elliot said: ""Yeah, OK."""
"Clarence said: ""Leave the gorillas.""
Elliot said: ""- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -""
Clarence said: ""Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime."""
"Clarence said: ""I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.""
Elliot said: ""Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?""
Clarence said: ""Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -""
Elliot said: ""Look, Dick, I don't -""
Clarence said: ""No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.""
Elliot said: ""What department?""
Clarence said: ""What do you think, eightball?""
Elliot said: ""The police department?""
Clarence said: ""Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.""
Elliot said: ""He trusts you?""
Clarence said: ""We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.""
Elliot said: ""Sure. I didn't hear anything."""
"Elliot said: ""What?""
Clarence said: ""Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?""
Elliot said: ""No. No, you don't.""
Clarence said: ""Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?"""
"Elliot said: ""Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.""
Clarence said: ""Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts."""
"Clarence said: ""He wants to talk ya.""
Elliot said: ""Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing."""
"Elliot said: ""He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.""
Clarence said: ""No problems on both counts."""
"Elliot said: ""Where's everybody else?""
Clarence said: ""They'll be along."""
"Clarence said: ""Well, I guess it's about that time.""
Elliot said: ""I guess so. Follow me."""
"Clarence said: ""Elliot.""
Elliot said: ""Yeah?""
Clarence said: ""Get on your knees."""
"Clarence said: ""Don't you?""
Elliot said: ""No.""
Clarence said: ""Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!"""
"Clarence said: ""Say it, goddamn it!""
Elliot said: ""You are the dumbest person in the world.""
Clarence said: ""Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.""
Elliot said: ""No. No you're not.""
Clarence said: ""What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face."""
"Customer said: ""Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.""
Clarence said: ""Have you read the story on Elvis?""
Customer said: ""No. Not yet.""
Clarence said: ""You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.""
Customer said: ""That good, huh?"""
"Clarence said: ""It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.""
Customer said: ""I can see what you mean.""
Clarence said: ""Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick."""
"Lee said: ""I don't know, Clarence, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a pretty big movie.""
Clarence said: ""The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot."""
"Lee said: ""But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.""
Clarence said: ""Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is ""Doctor Zhivago"". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine."""
"Lee said: ""Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to ""Doctor Zhivago"" are in arbitration?""
Clarence said: ""I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire."""
"Clarence said: ""Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these ""Soldier of Fortune"" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.""
Lee said: ""I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody."""
"Clarence said: ""Oh, Mr. Donowitz -""
Lee said: ""Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.""
Clarence said: ""OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"" is one of my favorite movies. After ""Apocalypse Now"" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.""
Lee said: ""Thank you very much, Clarence.""
Clarence said: ""You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. ""Sophie's Choice"", ""Ordinary People"", ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Gandhi"". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.""
Lee said: ""I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.""
Clarence said: ""Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books."""
"Clarence said: ""Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.""
Lee said: ""Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.""
Clarence said: ""Me too, Boris."""
"Lee said: ""You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?""
Clarence said: ""I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up."""
"Lee said: ""Where'd you go?""
Clarence said: ""A Norms in Van Nuys.""
Lee said: ""Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys."""
"Lee said: ""Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.""
Clarence said: ""Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.""
Lee said: ""Why does he trust you?""
Clarence said: ""We grew up together.""
Lee said: ""If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?""
Clarence said: ""I bullshitted him."""
"Lee said: ""Wanna count your money?""
Clarence said: ""Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room."""
"Cliff said: ""I think there's a Seven-Up in there.""
Clarence said: ""Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?""
Cliff said: ""I can, but I don't.""
Clarence said: ""That's about all I ever eat."""
"Clarence said: ""Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?""
Cliff said: ""Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.""
Clarence said: ""Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?"""
"Cliff said: ""I'm really not very -""
Clarence said: ""You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?""
Cliff said: ""I really don't know.""
Clarence said: ""You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is."""
"Clarence said: ""Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?""
Cliff said: ""She seems very nice.""
Clarence said: ""Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -""
Cliff said: ""Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?""
Clarence said: ""Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help."""
"Clarence said: ""Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.""
Cliff said: ""You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!"""
"Cliff said: ""What do you want from me?""
Clarence said: ""What?""
Cliff said: ""Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?""
Clarence said: ""Do you still have friends on the force?""
Cliff said: ""Yes, I still have friends on the force.""
Clarence said: ""Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?""
Cliff said: ""What makes you think I could do that?""
Clarence said: ""You were a cop.""
Cliff said: ""What makes you think I would do that?""
Clarence said: ""I'm your son.""
Cliff said: ""You got it all worked out, don't you?""
Clarence said: ""Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always ""OK"", ""No problem"", ""You're a busy guy, I understand"". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems."""
"Cliff said: ""They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.""
Clarence said: ""Do tell. Why drug related?""
Cliff said: ""Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.""
Clarence said: ""No shit?""
Cliff said: ""Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?""
Clarence said: ""Nope.""
Cliff said: ""If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.""
Clarence said: ""Who is he?""
Cliff said: ""Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.""
Clarence said: ""That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?""
Cliff said: ""Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it."""
"Clarence said: ""Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.""
Cliff said: ""I got some money I can give you -""
Clarence said: ""Keep it.""
Cliff said: ""Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.""
Clarence said: ""We do make a cute couple, don't we?""
Cliff said: ""Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son."""
"Coccotti said: ""Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?""
Cliff said: ""I give up. Who are you?""
Coccotti said: ""I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?""
Cliff said: ""I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.""
Coccotti said: ""I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?""
Cliff said: ""No.""
Coccotti said: ""I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.""
Cliff said: ""Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -"""
"Cliff said: ""I've seen him.""
Coccotti said: ""Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.""
Cliff said: ""What are you talkin' about?""
Coccotti said: ""I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.""
Cliff said: ""I don't believe you.""
Coccotti said: ""That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?""
Cliff said: ""On their honeymoon.""
Coccotti said: ""I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?""
Cliff said: ""They didn't tell me."""
"Cliff said: ""Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?""
Coccotti said: ""Sure."""
"Cliff said: ""Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?""
Coccotti said: ""Uh-huh.""
Cliff said: ""You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers."""
"Coccotti said: ""Come again?""
Cliff said: ""It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?"""
"Cliff said: ""It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.""
Wilson said: ""What about him?""
Cliff said: ""Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.""
Wilson said: ""Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?""
Cliff said: ""Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?""
Wilson said: ""McTeague.""
Cliff said: ""I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?""
Wilson said: ""I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?""
Cliff said: ""You and Robin moved?""
Wilson said: ""Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla."""
"Dick said: ""I'm me... I mean, that's me.""
Ravencroft said: ""Step inside."""
"Ravencroft said: ""Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.""
Dick said: ""Where'd you come from?""
Ravencroft said: ""I don't know. He just appeared as magic.""
Dick said: ""Well, don't just sit there, shoot him."""
"Ravencroft said: ""That was very good.""
Dick said: ""Thank you.""
Ravencroft said: ""If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?""
Dick said: ""Sure. No problem.""
Ravencroft said: ""Could we try it now?""
Dick said: ""Absolutely."""
"Dick said: ""Where'd he come from?""
Ravencroft said: ""I don't know. He just appeared as magic.""

"Krinkle said: ""Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?""
Dimes said: ""Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him."""
"Krinkle said: ""That Vietnam movie?""
Dimes said: ""Uh-huh.""
Krinkle said: ""That was a good fuckin' movie.""
Dimes said: ""Sure was.""
Krinkle said: ""Do you believe him?""
Dimes said: ""I believe he believes him."""
"Krinkle said: ""He'll wear a wire?""
Dimes said: ""We talked him into it.""
Krinkle said: ""Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.""
Dimes said: ""Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust."""
"Nicholson said: ""Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -""
Dimes said: ""Not a tiny little vial -""
Nicholson said: ""But a fuckin' baggie.""
Dimes said: ""No don't sit here and feed us some shit.""
Nicholson said: ""You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -""
Dimes said: ""You're no longer an extra -""
Nicholson said: ""Or a bit player -""
Dimes said: ""Or a supporting actor -""
Nicholson said: ""You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -""
Dimes said: ""But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -""
Nicholson said: ""And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.""
Dimes said: ""'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -""
Nicholson said: ""That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions."""
"Dimes said: ""Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -""
Nicholson said: ""Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -"""
"Nicholson said: ""Nicholson and I.""
Dimes said: ""Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.""
Nicholson said: ""Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.""
Dimes said: ""So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it."""
"Dimes said: ""Suspect's words -""
Nicholson said: ""To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.""
Dimes said: ""He produced ""Coming Home in a Body Bag""."""
"Nicholson said: ""He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.""
Dimes said: ""This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire."""
"Nicholson said: ""Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.""
Dimes said: ""We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.""
Nicholson said: ""So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke."""
"Dimes said: ""You do more than try.""
Nicholson said: ""You do.""
Dimes said: ""Hope you're a good actor, Elliot."""
"Dimes said: ""He knows.""
Nicholson said: ""How the fuck could he know?""
Dimes said: ""He saw the wire.""
Nicholson said: ""How's he supposed to see the wire?""
Dimes said: ""He knows something's up."""
"Nicholson said: ""We gotta get him outta there.""
Dimes said: ""Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator."""
"Nicholson said: ""He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.""
Dimes said: ""This guy's gonna kill him."""
"Nicholson said: ""Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.""
Dimes said: ""You're an actor, so act, motherfucker."""

Floyd said: ""Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker."""
"Floyd said: ""Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -""
Drexl said: ""- Because it's good!""
Floyd said: ""Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere."""

Drexl said: ""Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say ""Bitch, suck my dick!"" and then Jayne Kennedy says, ""First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!""

"Railly said: ""James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?""
Cole said: ""What?""
Railly said: ""I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?""
Cole said: ""Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?"""
"Railly said: ""It's just a shot to calm you.""
Cole said: ""No more drugs.  Please...""
Railly said: ""I have to do this, James.  You're very confused."""
"Railly said: ""Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.""
Cole said: ""1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!"""
"Railly said: ""I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?""
Cole said: ""You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?""
Railly said: ""Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?""
Cole said: ""It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?"""
"Cole said: ""You used to call me ""James"".""
Railly said: ""You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.""
Cole said: ""Everybody's got a gun.  In this city..."""
"Cole said: """"Never cry wolf!""""
Railly said: ""What?""
Cole said: ""My father told me that.  ""Never cry wolf.""  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.""
Railly said: """"If something really happens""...like what, James?""
Cole said: ""Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff..."""
"Railly said: ""Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?""
Cole said: ""Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?"""
"Cole said: ""You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.""
Railly said: ""We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?""
Cole said: ""About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.""
Railly said: ""And I was in it?  What did I do?""
Cole said: ""You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.""
Railly said: ""It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me."""
"Cole said: ""No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.""
Railly said: ""You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?"""
"Cole said: ""My notes.  Observations.  Clues.""
Railly said: ""Clues?  What kind of clues?""
Cole said: ""A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.""
Railly said: ""What will you do...when you find this...secret army?""
Cole said: ""I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth."""
"Railly said: ""Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?""
Cole said: ""When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.""
Railly said: ""What do you mean -- when you were a kid?""
Cole said: ""Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!"""
"Cole said: ""Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!""
Railly said: ""I'm not going to ""do"" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is."""
"Cole said: ""They're keeping an eye on me.""
Railly said: ""Who's keeping an eye on you?""
Cole said: ""The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He..."""
"Cole said: ""Are you hurt?""
Railly said: ""Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes..."""
"Railly said: ""Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!""
Cole said: ""I did him a favor.  Now come on."""
"Railly said: ""You didn't have a gun before, did you?""
Cole said: ""I've got one now."""
"Cole said: ""I told you what I want.  Lock the door!""
Railly said: ""James, why don't we...?""
Cole said: ""Lock it now!"""
"Cole said: ""Mason???""
Railly said: ""Jeffrey Mason?"""
"Cole said: ""All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?""
Railly said: ""You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago."""
"Cole said: ""The guy was a total fruitcake.""
Railly said: ""And he told you then his father was a famous virologist."""
"Cole said: ""We need gas.""
Railly said: ""I thought you didn't know how to drive.""
Cole said: ""I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.""
Railly said: ""What's the matter with your leg?""
Cole said: ""I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.""
Railly said: ""Shot!  Who shot you?""
Cole said: ""It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here."""
"Cole said: ""You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?""
Railly said: ""No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.""
Cole said: ""That has your name on it.  Give him cash."""
"Cole said: ""You smell so good.""
Railly said: ""You have to give yourself up, you know."""
"Railly said: ""What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?""
Cole said: ""No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.""
Railly said: ""See -- you can drive after all!""
Cole said: ""Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!"""
"Railly said: ""What made you think that?""
Cole said: ""Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?""
Railly said: ""Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.""
Cole said: ""I'm...""mentally divergent"".  I would love to believe that.""
Railly said: ""It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you."""
"Cole said: ""I need help all right.  They're coming after me.""
Railly said: ""First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?""
Cole said: ""It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.""
Railly said: ""Give me the gun.""
Cole said: ""The gun! ... I lost it""
Railly said: ""You're sure?""
Cole said: ""No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!"""
"Railly said: ""James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...""
Cole said: ""No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well..."""
"Cole said: ""I don't understand what we're doing.""
Railly said: ""We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.""
Cole said: ""You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them."""
"Railly said: ""Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?""
Cole said: ""I thought I was in...prison again.""
Railly said: ""Just like that?  You were in prison?""
Cole said: ""No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.""
Railly said: ""You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?""
Cole said: ""I don't know -- I don't remember.""
Railly said: ""The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?""
Cole said: ""It was?  I didn't...know.""
Railly said: ""James, you said he was hiding in the barn...""
Cole said: ""I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...""
Railly said: ""IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!"""
"Railly said: ""What does this mean to you?""
Cole said: ""...I had a dream about...something like that.""
Railly said: ""You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?""
Cole said: ""You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...""
Railly said: ""Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon."""
"Cole said: ""I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.""
Railly said: ""James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and..."""
"Cole said: ""You want me to rob him?""
Railly said: ""I...I...We need cash, James."""
"Railly said: ""It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...""
Cole said: ""A Carpet Cleaning Company?""
Railly said: ""No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.""
Cole said: ""You... you left them a message?""
Railly said: ""I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys..."""
"Railly said: ""You... you couldn't have heard me.""
Cole said: ""They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice."""
"Cole said: ""I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.""
Railly said: ""Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.""
Cole said: ""I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.""
Railly said: ""If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.""
Cole said: ""Flowers!  What flowers?"""
"Cole said: ""Why are we doing this?""
Railly said: ""So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry."""
"Cole said: ""But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.""
Railly said: ""In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police."""
"Cole said: ""You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.""
Railly said: ""Well, you look pretty different, too.""
Cole said: ""I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.""
Railly said: ""I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you."""
"Railly said: ""That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!""
Cole said: ""On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, ""We did it."""""
"Cole said: ""I know this place! ... This is my dream.""
Railly said: ""Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping."""
"Railly said: ""They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.""
Cole said: ""I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.""
Railly said: ""James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!""
Cole said: ""Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.""
Railly said: ""I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop."""
"Dr. Fletcher said: ""Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?""
Cole said: ""No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.""
Dr. Fletcher said: ""Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?""
Cole said: ""Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.""
Dr. Fletcher said: ""So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?""
Cole said: ""No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, ""voice mail"".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present."""
"Jeffrey said: ""What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.""
Cole said: ""I need to make a telephone call.""
Jeffrey said: ""A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!

Jeffrey said: ""In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible ""bad things"" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...""germs""!"""
"Jeffrey said: """"What about the germs?""  I say.  He goes, ""I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!"" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?""
Cole said: ""I'm not crazy.""
Jeffrey said: ""Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?""
Cole said: ""If you know how to escape, why don't you...?""
Jeffrey said: ""Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.""
Cole said: ""What's that mean?""
Jeffrey said: ""I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father.

"Jeffrey said: ""Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.""

Jeffrey said: ""Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet.

Blind Man said: ""Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.""
John said: ""I said I was sorry.""
Blind Man said: ""Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.""
John said: ""Yeah, sure.  You got change?""
Blind Man said: ""Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?""
John said: ""All right, old man.  Christ."""
"Blind Man said: ""Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.""
John said: ""Yeah, yeah."""
"Blind Man said: ""Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.""
John said: ""Christ!"""
"John said: ""I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.""
Blind Man said: ""That's 'cause he's dead."""
"John said: ""Oh, Jesus.""
Blind Man said: ""I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?""
John said: ""What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?""
Blind Man said: ""He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?""
John said: ""He no!""
Blind Man said: ""See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . ."""
"John said: ""You sure seen a lot for a blind man.""
Blind Man said: ""Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.""
John said: ""That a fact?""
Blind Man said: ""I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.""
John said: ""Maybe I do.""
Blind Man said: ""Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.""
John said: ""I think I've heard that before.""
Blind Man said: ""What do you want for free?""
John said: ""You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.""
Blind Man said: ""That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.""
John said: ""Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.""
Blind Man said: ""Think you'll live that long?"""
"Blind Man said: ""Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?""
John said: ""I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.""
Blind Man said: ""I won't hold my breath."""
"John said: ""The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.""
Blind Man said: ""Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.""
John said: ""You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.""
Blind Man said: ""Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.""
John said: ""You afraid of the dark?""
Blind Man said: ""Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.""
John said: ""You don't fear death?""
Blind Man said: ""We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.""
John said: ""We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?""
Blind Man said: ""More or less.""
John said: ""Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.""
Blind Man said: ""We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.""
John said: ""No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.""
Blind Man said: ""Same back at you."""
"John said: ""Any parting words of wisdom?""
Blind Man said: ""Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?"""

Boyd said: ""Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?""
John said: ""Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it."""

"Ed said: ""It's nonsense.""
Boyd said: ""It is not.""
Ed said: ""A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.""
Boyd said: ""It will.""
Ed said: ""No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics."""
"Boyd said: ""And what are you?  A rocket scientist?""
Ed said: ""I got more brains than you've got teeth.""
Boyd said: ""Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right."""

Clerk said: ""Where in Mexico would you like--""

Clerk said: ""One way, or round trip?""
John said: ""One way.""
Clerk said: ""Thirty even."""

"Darrell said: ""It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.""
John said: ""I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?""
Darrell said: ""Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?""
John said: ""If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?""
Darrell said: ""Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?""
John said: ""Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?"""
"John said: ""Hey!""
Darrell said: ""Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.""
John said: ""How much time?""
Darrell said: ""Time.""
John said: ""What time is it now?""
Darrell said: ""Twenty-after-ten.""
John said: ""Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.""
Darrell said: ""Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . ."""

Darrell said: ""Another accident?  You got to be more careful."""

Darrell said: ""She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.""
John said: ""How much?""
Darrell said: ""Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.""
John said: ""How much!?""
Darrell said: ""Hundred-fifty.""
John said: ""To replace a God damn radiator hose!?""
Darrell said: ""A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?""
John said: ""About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.""
Darrell said: ""That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?""
John said: ""That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?""
Darrell said: ""That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.""
John said: ""What's that got to do with the radiator hose?""
Darrell said: ""I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.""
John said: ""It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.""
Darrell said: ""Then you ain't gonna have the car.""
John said: ""Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had."""
"Darrell said: ""Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.""
John said: ""I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.""
Darrell said: ""Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.""
John said: ""You son of a bitch!""
Darrell said: ""Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars."""
"Darrell said: ""Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.""
John said: ""Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.""
Darrell said: ""One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?""
John said: ""You've been there?""
Darrell said: ""Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.""
John said: ""You believe that?""
Darrell said: ""You think bad, and bad is what you get.""
John said: ""That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.""
Darrell said: ""No charge.""
John said: ""Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--""
Darrell said: ""Two-hundred.""
John said: ""What?""
Darrell said: ""It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.""
John said: ""You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.""
Darrell said: ""Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.""
John said: ""I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.""
Darrell said: ""Yeah, but it was shot.""
John said: ""I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.""
Darrell said: ""Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.""
John said: ""What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.""
Darrell said: ""Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.""
John said: ""Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.""
Darrell said: ""Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.""
John said: ""I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!""
Darrell said: ""You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage."""
"John said: ""No!""
Darrell said: ""What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.""
John said: ""Please, just leave the car alone.""
Darrell said: ""Yeah, you better remember that."""
"John said: ""Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!""
Darrell said: ""There you go, sweet talking me again."""
"Darrell said: ""What you want?""
John said: ""Open up!""
Darrell said: ""We're closed.  Come back in the morning.""
John said: ""It is morning.""
Darrell said: ""Come back when the sun comes up."""
"Darrell said: ""What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?""
John said: ""I want my car.""
Darrell said: ""You got the money?"""
"Darrell said: ""Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.""
John said: ""What's it to you?""
Darrell said: ""I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.""
John said: ""Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?"""
"Flo said: ""Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?""

John said: ""Let me have a Beck's.""
Flo said: ""We ain't got no Beck's.""
John said: ""Kirin?""
Flo said: ""No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.""
John said: ""Genuine Draft?""
Flo said: ""No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?""
John said: ""Yeah, give me the Miller."""
"Flo said: ""Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.""
John said: ""Yeah, I'll try."""
"Sheriff said: ""What was that all about?""
Flo said: ""You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.""
Sheriff said: ""More like Jenny is after every man she sees.""
Flo said: ""You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?"""
"Flo said: ""Poor thing.  Is she all right?""
Sheriff said: ""'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died."""
"Flo said: ""Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.""
Sheriff said: ""Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died."""
"Flo said: ""Let me get your change.""
Sheriff said: ""Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee."""
"Flo said: ""Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?""
Sheriff said: ""I think I burned my gun hand!""
Flo said: ""It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up."""
"Sheriff said: ""That yours, Mrs. McKenna?""
Grace said: ""Yes.  Yes it is.""
Sheriff said: ""Taking a little trip?""
Grace said: ""I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.""
Sheriff said: ""Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?""
Grace said: ""I . . ."""
"Sheriff said: ""I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?""
Grace said: ""John . . ."""
"Sheriff said: ""Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.""
Grace said: ""He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too."""
"Sheriff said: ""For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.""
Grace said: ""What do you want?""
Sheriff said: ""Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money."""
"Sheriff said: "". . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?""
Grace said: ""Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.""
Sheriff said: ""Can't I?  You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk.  What do you think, boy?"""
"Sheriff said: ""There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.""
Grace said: ""John--"""

Grace said: ""Sheriff Potter."""

Jake said: ""Who the hell is this!?"""

Jake said: ""I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?""

Jake said: ""They look nice.""

Jake said: ""Uh-huh"""
"Jake said: ""What the hell you looking at, girl?""
Grace said: ""Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing."""
"Grace said: ""What's the matter?""
Jake said: ""You didn't hear something?""
Grace said: ""How could I?  I was sleeping.""
Jake said: ""There's someone in the house.""
Grace said: ""I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.""
Jake said: ""The wind isn't blowing."""
"Grace said: ""Jake, what is that?""
Jake said: ""What does it look like?""
Grace said: ""When did you buy a gun?"""
"Grace said: ""Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.""
Jake said: ""What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.""
Grace said: ""Jake.  No.  No!"""

Grace said: ""Do you have to call me that?""
John said: ""I don't know your real name.""
Grace said: ""Maybe I don't want you to.""

John said: ""Accident.""
Grace said: ""You should be more careful."""
"Grace said: ""It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.""
John said: ""No trouble at all, really."""
"John said: ""Wasn't nothing.""
Grace said: ""Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.""
John said: ""That's all right.  I got it."""
"John said: ""It's nothing.  Really.""
Grace said: ""I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.""
John said: ""That a fact?""
Grace said: ""I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?""
John said: ""Yes, I have.""

John said: ""You're welcome, Grace.""

John said: ""Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?""
Grace said: ""You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.""
John said: ""I just drove in this morning.""
Grace said: ""Drove into Sierra?  What for?""
John said: ""Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.""
Grace said: ""Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.""
John said: ""Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.""
Grace said: ""Least you can leave.""
John said: ""Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.""
Grace said: ""And here I've made you all hot and sweaty."""

John said: ""All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.""
Grace said: ""You've been around.""
John said: ""I guess I've got wander in my blood.""
Grace said: ""Where you headed?""
John said: ""I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.""
Grace said: ""You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.""
John said: ""If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.""
Grace said: ""What happens if you lose?""
John said: ""I pack up and go somewhere else.""
Grace said: ""Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.""
John said: ""I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out."""
"John said: ""That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.""
Grace said: ""I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.""
John said: ""I didn't say it bothered me.""
Grace said: ""Did you like it; me watching you?""
John said: ""I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.""
Grace said: ""Good, 'cause I liked what I saw."""
"John said: ""Nice place you got here.""
Grace said: ""Thank you."""
"John said: ""Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.""
Grace said: ""I guess it must.""
John said: ""What do you do anyway?""
Grace said: ""A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.""
John said: ""Where'd you learn to do that?""
Grace said: ""From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.""
John said: ""A medicine man?""
Grace said: ""Those are white words, not ours.""
John said: ""Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.""
Grace said: ""Come here."""
"John said: ""My face tell you all that?""
Grace said: ""It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?""
John said: ""The same thing you do."""
"Grace said: ""There.  All done.  Lift me down.""
John said: ""What?""
Grace said: ""Lift me down."""
"Grace said: ""You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.""
John said: ""Like you.""
Grace said: ""Beautiful?""
John said: ""Like they're made of polyester.""
Grace said: ""I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.""
John said: ""Nothing like a little liveliness."""
"Grace said: ""No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?""
John said: ""I have ideas.""
Grace said: ""Such as?"""
"John said: ""All right, Grace.  No more games.""
Grace said: ""Games?""
John said: ""You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.""
Grace said: ""Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?"""
"John said: ""I think I can find my own way back to into town.""
Grace said: ""Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.""
John said: ""I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade."""
"Grace said: ""You never did answer my question.""
John said: ""Still playing?""
Grace said: ""That's not an answer.  What is it you want?""
John said: ""You know what I want.""
Grace said: ""Maybe I just want to hear you say it."""
"John said: ""Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.""
Grace said: ""If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true."""
"John said: ""Doesn't the heat bother you?""
Grace said: ""Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.""
John said: ""You love him?""
Grace said: ""No.""
John said: ""Did you ever?""
Grace said: ""Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?""
John said: ""I'm guessing no.""
Grace said: ""Yeah, I guess you're right.""
John said: ""And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.""
Grace said: ""I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?"""
"Grace said: ""All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.""
John said: ""You could just leave him.""
Grace said: ""I don't know how.""
John said: ""You just walk away.""
Grace said: ""It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.""
John said: ""You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.""
Grace said: ""Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.""
John said: ""Whatever it takes."""
"Grace said: ""How far is it to California?""
John said: ""From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.""
Grace said: ""Have you ever been there before?""
John said: ""Yeah.""
Grace said: ""Is it pretty?""
John said: ""Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.""
Grace said: ""Take me with you.""
John said: ""I can't.""
Grace said: ""Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.""
John said: ""Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.""
Grace said: ""I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.""
John said: ""Where?""
Grace said: ""Jake.""
John said: ""You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?""
Grace said: ""He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.""
John said: ""From?""
Grace said: ""He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.""
John said: ""You live pretty good.""
Grace said: ""Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.""
John said: ""How much money has he got?""
Grace said: ""Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.""
John said: ""One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.""
Grace said: ""Lied?  What do you mean?""
John said: ""I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--""
Grace said: ""It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.""
John said: ""If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .""
Grace said: ""We'd have to kill him."""
"Grace said: ""John?  John where are you going?""
John said: ""I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.""
Grace said: ""John, please--""
John said: ""I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.""
Grace said: ""What are you talking about?""
John said: ""Kill someone.  I can't do it.""
Grace said: ""Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it."""
"John said: ""Shit!""
Grace said: ""It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.""
John said: ""Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it."""
"Grace said: ""I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?""
John said: ""I wanted to talk.""
Grace said: ""I don't think we have anything to talk about.""
John said: ""What about us?""
Grace said: ""There is no us, remember?""
John said: ""Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.""
John said: ""I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.""
Grace said: ""Stop it.""
John said: ""Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?""
Grace said: ""Because I know you're full of shit.""
John said: ""I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.""
Grace said: ""I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.""
John said: ""I could if I had Jake's money.""
Grace said: ""Is that what changed your mind?  The money?""
John said: ""I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.""
Grace said: ""Are you sure?  About me, I mean?""
John said: ""I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.""
John said: ""The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.""
Grace said: ""You said you couldn't kill anybody.""
John said: ""We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away."""
"John said: ""Grace . . . Grace?""
Grace said: ""After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked."""
"John said: ""Why the hell didn't you do anything?""
Grace said: ""What was I supposed to do?""
John said: ""You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls."""
"John said: ""Where's the safe?""
Grace said: ""I don't know.""
John said: ""You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?""
Grace said: ""I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.""
John said: ""Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!""
Grace said: ""Don't yell at me!"""
"John said: ""Nothing.  There's no safe under here.""
Grace said: ""There has to be!""
John said: ""There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor."""
"Grace said: ""It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.""
John said: ""This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.""
Grace said: ""If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?""
John said: ""You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?""
Grace said: ""Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!"""
"John said: ""There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.""
Grace said: ""I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?"""
"Grace said: ""If you want.""
John said: ""We're going all the way.  Together."""
"John said: ""Let's go in the bedroom.""
Grace said: ""No."""
"Grace said: ""Let's do it here.""
John said: ""What about him?""
Grace said: ""Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing."""
"John said: ""You got a suitcase?""
Grace said: ""Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.""
John said: ""Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.""
Grace said: ""Where are you going?""
John said: ""To get my car.""
Grace said: ""Wait.  What about . . . him?""
John said: ""Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him."""
"Grace said: ""John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?""
John said: ""I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.""
Grace said: ""I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.""
John said: ""Yeah.  Good thinking.""
Grace said: ""Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.""
John said: ""Funny thing."""
"Grace said: ""John . . .?""
John said: ""Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant."""
"Grace said: ""Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.""
John said: ""You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!"""
"John said: ""One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.""
Grace said: ""Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.""
John said: ""No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone."""
"Grace said: ""That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.""
John said: ""Not me.  Us.""
Grace said: ""It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.""
John said: ""Give him the money.""
Grace said: ""What?""
John said: ""You heard me.  Count it out.""
Grace said: ""He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.""
John said: ""He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars."""
"Grace said: ""I shot him.""
John said: ""You killed him!""
Grace said: ""He was going to take the money.""
John said: ""Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.""
Grace said: ""It's our money.  He had no right to take it."""
"John said: ""You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?""
Grace said: ""Just drive."""
"John said: ""Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?""
Grace said: ""He was going to--""
John said: ""I know.  He was to take the fucking money.""
Grace said: ""You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?""
John said: ""You killed a man for no reason!"""
"Grace said: ""Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?""
John said: ""You could give me the gun."""
"John said: ""Well, nothing.""
Grace said: ""Now what?""
John said: ""Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.""
Grace said: ""But you said we could be together.""
John said: ""Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.""
Grace said: ""What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.""
John said: ""<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.""
Grace said: ""He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.""
John said: ""The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.""
Grace said: ""But I want to say with you,""
John said: ""Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.""
Grace said: ""I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?""
John said: ""I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care."""
"Grace said: ""John!""
John said: ""Grace!"""
"Grace said: ""Are you all right?""
John said: ""I think I busted my leg.""
Grace said: ""Can you climb back up."""
"John said: ""I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?""
Grace said: ""I'm here.""
John said: ""Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.""
Grace said: ""I'll get it."""
"Grace said: ""John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?""
John said: ""Where the hell am I going to go?""
Grace said: ""John, you have to throw the keys up to me."""
"Grace said: ""John, throw me the keys.""
John said: ""What for?""
Grace said: ""The trunk.  It's locked.""
John said: ""It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.""
Grace said: ""It's . . . it's locked.""
John said: ""You closed it, didn't you, Grace?""
Grace said: ""I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.""
John said: ""Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.""
Grace said: ""No.  I swear it.""
John said: ""And you're not one to lie, are you?""
Grace said: ""Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.""
John said: ""Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?"""
"Grace said: ""John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.""
John said: ""Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?""
Grace said: ""Someone will find me.""
John said: ""Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.""
Grace said: ""You idiot!  You'll kill us both!""
John said: ""At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?""
Grace said: ""For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!""
John said: ""What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.""
Grace said: ""Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?"""
"John said: ""Who the hell are you?""
Jake said: ""I'm her husband.""
John said: ""Husband . . .?""
Jake said: ""Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.""
John said: ""I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.""
Jake said: ""Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.""
John said: ""I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.""
Jake said: ""A lot that means.""
John said: ""Grace, tell him."""
"Jake said: ""I have half a mind to--""
John said: ""Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way."""
"Jake said: ""What happened to your hand?""
John said: ""Accident.""
Jake said: ""You've got to be--""
John said: ""Yeah, I know.  More careful.""
Jake said: ""I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.""
John said: ""Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.""
Jake said: ""I'm a solid man.""
John said: ""John Stewart.""
Jake said: ""What brings you to Sierra?""
John said: ""My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.""
Jake said: ""Where you headed?""
John said: ""I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.""
Jake said: ""Live there?""
John said: ""Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.""
Jake said: ""You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.""
John said: ""I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--""
Jake said: ""It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.""
John said: ""Wait a second--""
Jake said: ""Ah, I can smell it on you."""
"John said: ""Hey!""
Jake said: ""That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?"""
"Jake said: ""She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.""
John said: ""Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em."""
"Jake said: ""I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.""
John said: ""Like you don't know.""
Jake said: ""Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you."""
"Jake said: ""Would you?""
John said: ""Would I what?""
Jake said: ""Would you kill her?"""
"John said: ""Why would I kill her?""
Jake said: ""Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it."""
"John said: ""I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.""
Jake said: ""How do you know if you've never tried?""
John said: ""This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?"""
"Jake said: ""Good Lord.  What happened to you?""
John said: ""Just ran into a little trouble.""
Jake said: ""Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?""
John said: ""No.""
Jake said: ""Hungry?""
John said: ""No.""
Jake said: ""I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.""
John said: ""I had a problem getting my car back.""
Jake said: ""You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?"""
"John said: ""Nice office you've got.""
Jake said: ""I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.""
John said: ""Isn't that illegal?"""
"Jake said: ""Now what can I do for you?""
John said: ""I was hoping we could talk.""
Jake said: ""Talk?  About what?""
John said: ""About things.  About your wife.""
Jake said: ""Sweet Grace?  What about her?""
John said: ""About what you said this morning."""
"John said: ""You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.""
Jake said: ""I do.""
John said: ""You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.""
Jake said: ""I did?""
John said: ""Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.""
Jake said: ""I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.""
John said: ""I'm not rambling.""
Jake said: ""You're talking like a mad man.""
John said: ""You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.""
Jake said: ""That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.""
John said: ""Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.""
Jake said: ""A man doesn't always mean the things he says.""
John said: ""You meant it.""
Jake said: ""What makes you say that?""
John said: ""Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.""
Jake said: ""And what does that make you?""
John said: ""The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you."""
"Jake said: ""Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.""
John said: ""This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.""
Jake said: ""And for that you'd kill Grace?""
John said: ""For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.""
Jake said: ""Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.""
John said: ""How do you put a price on murder?""
Jake said: ""I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?""
John said: ""Make it twenty.""
Jake said: ""Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.""
John said: ""How much could you get?""
Jake said: ""Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.""
John said: ""I need thirteen.""
Jake said: ""That's a bit much.""
John said: ""You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing."""
"Jake said: ""You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.""
John said: ""I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.""
Jake said: ""Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.""
John said: ""Do we shake hands?""
Jake said: ""If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?"""
"John said: ""I guess I might as well get this done with.""
Jake said: ""The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.""
John said: ""What should I do?""
Jake said: ""How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.""
John said: ""You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.""
Jake said: ""Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . ."""
"Jake said: ""This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.""
John said: ""And tell her what?"""
"John said: ""I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .""
Jake said: ""Is the job done?""
John said: ""No.""
Jake said: ""You didn't kill her?""
John said: ""The time wasn't right.""
Jake said: ""You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.""
John said: ""You know what I mean.""
Jake said: ""I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?""
John said: ""You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?""
Jake said: ""I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.""
John said: ""You love her, but you hate her?""
Jake said: ""I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.""
John said: ""Shut up.""
Jake said: ""Came close this time and it scares you.""
John said: ""Drop it, Jake.""
Jake said: ""And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.""
John said: ""SHUT UP!"""
"John said: ""Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?""
Jake said: ""Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?""
John said: ""You think that's a lot of money?""
Jake said: ""All I have in the world.""
John said: ""That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man."""
"Jake said: ""Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.""
John said: ""No."""
"John said: ""Yeah, well, me too.""
Jake said: ""Trouble with the car again?""
John said: ""You could say.  I don't even have it yet.""
Jake said: ""Darrell giving you problems?""
John said: ""He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.""
Jake said: ""Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.""
John said: ""It's not like that.""
Jake said: ""Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.""
John said: ""Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--""
Jake said: ""You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.""
John said: ""Jake--""
Jake said: ""And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.""
John said: ""That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.""
Jake said: ""There's another reason?  It better be good.""
John said: ""I came for Grace.""
Jake said: ""You came to take my wife from me?""
John said: ""I came to kill her.""
Jake said: ""Liar.""
John said: ""It's the truth, Jake.""
Jake said: ""That's a thick change of heart.""
John said: ""Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.""
Jake said: ""That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.""
John said: ""Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money."""
"Jake said: ""I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.""
John said: ""Wh . . . what are you talking about?""
Jake said: ""This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.""
John said: ""Come on, Jake--""
Jake said: ""Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.""
John said: ""Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.""
Jake said: ""Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.""
John said: ""Christ, Jake, please--""
Jake said: ""Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?""
John said: ""You're not talking sense.""
Jake said: ""Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.""
John said: ""What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.""
Jake said: ""A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.""
John said: ""What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.""
Jake said: ""You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.""
John said: ""I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.""
Jake said: ""Not from where I stand.""
John said: ""It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.""
Jake said: ""What are you babbling about?""
John said: ""Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?"""
"Jake said: ""You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.""
John said: ""You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.""
Jake said: ""Two-hundred dollars.""
John said: ""Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder."""
"Toby said: ""I asked you a question.""
Jenny said: ""Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.""
Toby said: ""You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?"""
"Jenny said: ""Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.""
Toby said: ""Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of."""
"Jenny said: ""I want to stay.""
Toby said: ""I said come on!"""
"Jenny said: ""Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!""
Toby said: ""You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see."""
"Jenny said: ""Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?""
John said: ""What?""
Jenny said: ""I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?"""
"Jenny said: ""What happened to your hand?""
John said: ""Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.""
Jenny said: ""Got any requests?""
John said: ""That country shit all sounds the same to me.""
Jenny said: ""How about I pick one out for you?"""
"Jenny said: ""You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.""
John said: ""She's dead.""
Jenny said: ""Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?""
John said: ""I've had time to get over it.""
Jenny said: ""You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?""
John said: ""Oz.""
Jenny said: ""You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.""
John said: ""You're too quick for me."""
"Jenny said: ""Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.""
John said: ""For what?""
Jenny said: ""For defending my honor this afternoon.""
John said: ""I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.""
Jenny said: ""But you was going to fight for me.""
John said: ""I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.""
Jenny said: ""He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.""
John said: ""Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.""
Jenny said: ""That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.""
John said: ""How old are you?""
Jenny said: ""Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.""
John said: ""No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--"""
"Jenny said: ""You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.""
John said: ""What the hell are you talking about?""
Jenny said: ""What's your name anyway?"""
"Jenny said: ""Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.""
John said: ""Will you shut up!"""
"Jenny said: ""Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.""
John said: ""Get away from me!"""
"John said: ""I wasn't doing anything.""
Toby said: ""That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.""
John said: ""Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?"""
"John said: ""Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.""
Toby said: ""You expect me to believe that?""
John said: ""I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.""
Toby said: ""Mister, I'm calling you out.""
John said: ""What?  You want to fight?  Over her?"""
"John said: ""You're fucked.""
Toby said: ""You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?""
John said: ""They're not very imaginative?""
Toby said: ""'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.""
John said: ""Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.""
Toby said: ""Not before I settle with you.""
John said: ""Christ, I don't believe this.""
Toby said: ""Stand up.""
John said: ""I wasn't hitting on your girl!""
Toby said: ""Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit."""
"Toby said: ""Mister!""
John said: ""Oh, shit!"""
"Toby said: ""That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.""
John said: ""I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?"""
"Toby said: ""Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.""
John said: ""Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this."""
"Toby said: ""Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.""
John said: ""What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?""
Toby said: ""I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.""
John said: ""You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!""
Toby said: ""My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?"""
"Toby said: ""Now, what's this?""
John said: ""Give it to me!""
Toby said: ""Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?""
John said: ""I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!""
Toby said: ""This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me."""
"John said: ""Nooo!""
Toby said: ""I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . ."""
"Mr. Vesci said: ""John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.""
John said: ""I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere."""
"Mr. Vesci said: ""That's a shame, John.  A real shame.""
John said: ""You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.""
Mr. Vesci said: ""Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.""
John said: ""No.  He gets shot by the old lady.""
Mr. Vesci said: ""The old lady?""
John said: ""With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?""
Mr. Vesci said: ""You're the gambler.  You tell me.""
John said: ""I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money."""
"Mr. Vesci said: ""Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.""
John said: ""A hundred-forty-five really.""
Mr. Vesci said: ""A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is."""
"Mr. Vesci said: ""Do you understand me you little fuck?""
John said: ""Yes, Mr. Vesci.""
Mr. Vesci said: ""And John, don't make me come look for you."""
"Mr. Vesci said: ""Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.""
John said: ""Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . ."""
"Sheriff said: ""Kids.""
John said: ""Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.""
Sheriff said: ""He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.""
John said: ""What happened?""
Sheriff said: ""His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.""
John said: ""Jesus!""
Sheriff said: ""Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.""
John said: ""I guess.""
Sheriff said: ""Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?"""
"Sheriff said: ""Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.""
John said: ""No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.""
Sheriff said: ""Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.""
John said: ""Not as bad as it looks.""
Sheriff said: ""There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.""
John said: ""Wouldn't know anything about it.""
Sheriff said: ""That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.""
John said: ""Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.""
Sheriff said: ""Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.""
John said: ""Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town."""
"Sheriff said: ""Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.""
John said: ""Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.""
Sheriff said: ""Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.""
John said: ""Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -""
Sheriff said: ""Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.""
John said: ""Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?""
Sheriff said: ""Nope.  No problems up the road."""
"Sheriff said: ""Why don't you step out of the car, son?""
John said: ""I don't understand what the--""
Sheriff said: ""Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.""
John said: ""Sure, Sheriff."""
"Sheriff said: ""Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.""
John said: ""What for?""
Sheriff said: ""I think you might just want to do as I say.""
John said: ""There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.""
Sheriff said: ""And as soon as I see that you're on your way."""
"John said: ""You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!""
Sheriff said: ""Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.""
John said: ""I didn't do anything.""
Sheriff said: ""Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you."""
"John said: ""That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.""
Sheriff said: ""Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying."""
"Sheriff said: ""What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?""
John said: ""Thirty-thousand dollars.""
Sheriff said: ""You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . ."""
"Sheriff said: ""Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.""
John said: ""And you're taking?"""
"John said: ""Got any cold soda?""
Woman said: ""Eh?""
John said: ""Soda.  You got any soda?""
Woman said: ""Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.""
John said: ""Soda.  You know."""
"Woman said: ""I call the policia.""
John said: ""No!"""
"John said: ""No police.""
Woman said: ""But, Senor--""
John said: ""No police!  Wait until I'm gone.""
Woman said: ""Senor, you need a doctor.""
John said: ""No police!"""

Bobby said: ""You want something, old man?""
Blind Man said: ""Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?""

Blind Man said: ""Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.""
Bobby said: ""You can't do that yourself?""
Blind Man said: ""Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?""
Bobby said: ""I'm sorry, I didn't--""
Blind Man said: ""What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?""
Bobby said: ""I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.""
Blind Man said: ""I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?""
Bobby said: ""Christ no!""
Blind Man said: ""Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.""
Bobby said: ""I said I was sorry.""
Blind Man said: ""Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.""
Bobby said: ""Yeah, sure.  You got change?""
Blind Man said: ""Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?""

Blind Man said: ""I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?""
Bobby said: ""What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?""
Blind Man said: ""He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?""
Bobby said: ""Hell no!""
Blind Man said: ""See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse."""
"Bobby said: ""You sure seen a lot for a blind man.""
Blind Man said: ""Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.""
Bobby said: ""That a fact?"""
"Bobby said: ""Maybe I do.""
Blind Man said: ""Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.""
Bobby said: ""I think I've heard that before.""
Blind Man said: ""What do you want for free?""
Bobby said: ""You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.""
Blind Man said: ""Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.""
Bobby said: ""What?""
Blind Man said: ""...And everything is nothing too."""
"Blind Man said: ""Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.""
Bobby said: ""Who's cursed?""
Blind Man said: ""All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy."""
"Bobby said: ""I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?""
Blind Man said: ""So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.""
Bobby said: ""Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.""
Blind Man said: ""Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that ""om""! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, ""the more you eat, the more you want....""...""
Bobby said: ""I got things to do."""

Bobby said: ""I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.""

"Blind Man said: ""Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.""
Bobby said: ""Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.""
Blind Man said: ""Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.""
Bobby said: ""You afraid of the dark?""
Blind Man said: ""Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.""
Bobby said: ""So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?""
Blind Man said: ""More or less.""
Bobby said: ""Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.""
Blind Man said: ""Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.""
Bobby said: ""No and I don't plan on sticking around either.""
Blind Man said: ""Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.""
Bobby said: ""You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you."""
"Bobby said: ""Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?""
Blind Man said: ""Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart!

Bobby said: ""Oh, shit!"""
"Toby said: ""That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.""
Bobby said: ""I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?"""
"Toby said: ""Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.""
Bobby said: ""Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this."""
"Toby said: ""I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.""
Bobby said: ""You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!""
Toby said: ""My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?"""
"Toby said: ""Now, what's this?""
Bobby said: ""Give it to me!""
Toby said: ""Mexico?  You going to Mexico?""
Bobby said: ""I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!""
Toby said: ""This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me."""
"Jake said: ""Who the hell is this!?""
Bobby said: ""Who the hell are you?""
Jake said: ""I'm her husband."""
"Jake said: ""Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.""
Bobby said: ""Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.""
Jake said: ""Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.""
Bobby said: ""I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.""
Jake said: ""A lot that means.""
Bobby said: ""Grace, tell him."""
"Jake said: ""You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!""
Bobby said: ""You broke my nose!""
Jake said: ""It ain't broke."""
"Bobby said: ""What the fuck do you want?""
Jake said: ""I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know."""
"Jake said: ""After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.""
Bobby said: ""Yeah...""
Jake said: ""Say, what happened to your hand?""
Bobby said: ""Accident.""
Jake said: ""You've got to be--""
Bobby said: ""Yeah, I know.  More careful.""
Jake said: ""I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.""
Bobby said: ""That's a solid name.""
Jake said: ""I'm a solid man.""
Bobby said: ""Bobby Cooper.""
Jake said: """"Bobby Cooper."" What brings you to Superior, Coop?""
Bobby said: ""An overheated car.""
Jake said: ""Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?""
Bobby said: ""Darrell's a moron."""
"Bobby said: ""California...""
Jake said: ""Live there?""
Bobby said: ""Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.""
Jake said: ""You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.""
Bobby said: ""I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--""
Jake said: ""It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.""
Bobby said: ""Wait a second--""
Jake said: ""Ah, I can smell it on you."""
"Bobby said: ""Hey!""
Jake said: ""That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?"""
"Jake said: ""She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.""
Bobby said: ""Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em."""
"Jake said: """"You can't shoot 'em!"" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.""
Bobby said: ""Like you don't know.""
Jake said: ""Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you."""
"Jake said: ""Would you?""
Bobby said: ""Would I what?""
Jake said: ""Would you kill her?"""
"Bobby said: ""I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.""
Jake said: ""How do you know if you've never tried?""
Bobby said: ""This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?"""
"Jake said: ""What can I do for you, lad?""
Bobby said: ""I was hoping we could talk.""
Jake said: ""Talk?  About what?""
Bobby said: ""About things.  About your wife.""
Jake said: ""Sweet Grace?  What about her?""
Bobby said: ""About what you said this morning."""
"Bobby said: ""You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.""
Jake said: ""I do.""
Bobby said: ""You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.""
Jake said: ""I did?""
Bobby said: ""Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.""
Jake said: ""Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.""
Bobby said: ""I'm not rambling.""
Jake said: ""You're talking like a madman.""
Bobby said: ""Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.""
Jake said: ""Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.""
Bobby said: ""Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.""
Jake said: ""A man doesn't always mean the things he says.""
Bobby said: ""You meant it.""
Jake said: ""What makes you say that?""
Bobby said: ""Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.""
Jake said: ""And what does that make you?""
Bobby said: ""The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind."""
"Jake said: ""Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.""
Bobby said: ""You love her, but you hate her?""
Jake said: ""No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little ""games"" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?"""
"Bobby said: ""How much could you get?""
Jake said: ""Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.""
Bobby said: ""I need thirteen.""
Jake said: ""That's a bit much.""
Bobby said: ""We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing."""
"Jake said: ""You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.""
Bobby said: ""I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.""
Jake said: ""Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract."""
"Jake said: ""If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.""
Bobby said: ""How do you want it?""
Jake said: ""How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.""
Bobby said: ""You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.""
Jake said: ""Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be..."""
"Bobby said: ""Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?""
Jake said: ""Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.""
Bobby said: ""And tell her what?"""
"Jake said: ""...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.""
Bobby said: ""I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all."""
"Jake said: ""Next time you'll do just fine.""
Bobby said: ""No!"""
"Bobby said: ""That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!""
Jake said: ""I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out."""
"Jake said: ""I guess this is what they call ""ironee""? Hunh?""
Bobby said: ""It's not what you think, Jake.""
Jake said: ""No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!""
Bobby said: ""Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...""
Jake said: ""...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000..."""
"Bobby said: ""I came for Grace.""
Jake said: ""You came to take my wife from me?"""
"Jake said: ""Shhh! Liar.""
Bobby said: ""It's the truth, Jake.""
Jake said: ""That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.""
Bobby said: ""Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.""
Jake said: ""You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.""
Bobby said: ""Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money."""
"Jake said: ""How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?""
Bobby said: ""What are you talking about!"""
"Bobby said: ""Come on, Jake --""
Jake said: ""Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon..."""
"Jake said: ""You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.""
Bobby said: ""You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.""
Jake said: ""Two-hundred dollars?""
Bobby said: ""Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!"""
"Jenny said: ""Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?""
Bobby said: ""What?""
Jenny said: ""I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?"""
"Jenny said: ""What happened to your hand?""
Bobby said: ""I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.""
Jenny said: ""Got any requests?""
Bobby said: ""That country shit all sounds the same to me.""
Jenny said: ""How about I pick one out for you?"""
"Jenny said: ""You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.""
Bobby said: ""Cause she's dead.""
Jenny said: ""Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?""
Bobby said: ""I've had time to get over it.""
Jenny said: ""You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?""
Bobby said: ""Oz.""
Jenny said: ""You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.""
Bobby said: ""You're too quick for me."""
"Jenny said: ""Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.""
Bobby said: ""For what?""
Jenny said: ""For defending my honor this afternoon.""
Bobby said: ""I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.""
Jenny said: ""But you was going to fight for me.""
Bobby said: ""I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.""
Jenny said: ""He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.""
Bobby said: ""Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.""
Jenny said: ""That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.""
Bobby said: ""How old are you?""
Jenny said: ""Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.""
Bobby said: ""No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?"""
"Jenny said: ""You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.""
Bobby said: ""What the hell are you talking about?""
Jenny said: ""What's your name anyway?"""
"Jenny said: ""Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.""
Bobby said: ""Will you shut up!"""
"Jenny said: ""Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.""
Bobby said: ""Get away from me!"""
"Bobby said: ""You Harlin?""
Darrell said: ""Nope.  Darrell.""
Bobby said: ""Harlin around?""
Darrell said: ""He's up at the Look Out."""
"Bobby said: ""Will he be back soon?""
Darrell said: ""Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.""
Bobby said: ""You own this place?""
Darrell said: ""Yep.""
Bobby said: ""Then why do you call it Harlin's?""
Darrell said: ""'Cause Harlin used to own it.""
Bobby said: ""But he's dead.""
Darrell said: ""So?"""
"Bobby said: ""You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--""
Darrell said: ""Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in..."""
"Bobby said: ""Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.""
Darrell said: ""Darrell--""
Bobby said: ""OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted."""
"Bobby said: ""So?""
Darrell said: ""It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.""
Bobby said: ""I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?""
Darrell said: ""Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?""
Bobby said: ""If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?""
Darrell said: ""Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...""
Bobby said: ""Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?""
Darrell said: ""Yeah, I can fix it.""
Bobby said: ""Great!""
Darrell said: ""Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.""
Bobby said: ""How much time?""
Darrell said: ""Time."""
"Darrell said: ""Twenty-after-ten.""
Bobby said: ""Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.""
Darrell said: ""Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot."""
"Bobby said: ""Accident.""
Darrell said: ""You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.""
Bobby said: ""I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...""
Darrell said: ""Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.""
Bobby said: ""I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?"""
"Bobby said: ""Hey.""
Darrell said: ""Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?""
Bobby said: ""Nothing.""
Darrell said: ""Don't look like nothing.""
Bobby said: ""Just banged my head.  It was an accident.""
Darrell said: ""Another accident?  You got to be more careful."""
"Bobby said: ""What the hell happened to my car?""
Darrell said: ""Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now."""
"Darrell said: ""Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.""
Bobby said: ""How much!?""
Darrell said: ""Hundred-fifty.""
Bobby said: ""To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?""
Darrell said: ""A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?""
Bobby said: ""About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.""
Darrell said: ""Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?""
Bobby said: ""That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?""
Darrell said: """"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.""""
Bobby said: ""What's that got to do with the radiator hose?""
Darrell said: ""I don't know, but ""it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.""  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.""
Bobby said: ""It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.""
Darrell said: ""Then you ain't gonna have the car.""
Bobby said: ""Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had."""
"Darrell said: ""Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.""
Bobby said: ""I don't have a goddamn credit card.""
Darrell said: ""Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off."""
"Darrell said: ""...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .""
Bobby said: ""You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.""
Darrell said: ""You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...""
Bobby said: ""What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.""
Darrell said: ""I want my hundred and forty-five dollars."""
"Darrell said: ""Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.""
Bobby said: ""Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.""
Darrell said: ""One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?""
Bobby said: ""You've been there?""
Darrell said: ""Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.""
Bobby said: ""You believe that?""
Darrell said: ""You think bad, and bad is what you get.""
Bobby said: ""That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.""
Darrell said: ""No charge.""
Bobby said: ""Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--""
Darrell said: ""Two-hundred.""
Bobby said: ""What?""
Darrell said: ""It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.""
Bobby said: ""You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.""
Darrell said: ""Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.""
Bobby said: ""I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.""
Darrell said: ""Yeah, but it was shot.""
Bobby said: ""I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.""
Darrell said: ""Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.""
Bobby said: ""What sign?""
Darrell said: ""The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.""
Bobby said: ""What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.""
Darrell said: ""Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.""
Bobby said: ""Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.""
Darrell said: ""Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>."""
"Bobby said: ""No! Okay! Okay!""
Darrell said: ""What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two."""
"Bobby said: ""Look, Harlin.""
Darrell said: ""Darrell.""
Bobby said: ""Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk."""
"Bobby said: ""What the fuck did you do to my trunk?""
Darrell said: ""Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.""
Bobby said: ""And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?""
Darrell said: ""When I work on a car, I work on a car."""
"Darrell said: ""What you want?""
Bobby said: ""Open up!""
Darrell said: ""We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up."""
"Darrell said: ""What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?""
Bobby said: ""I want my car.""
Darrell said: ""You got the money?"""
"Darrell said: ""Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.""
Bobby said: ""That's none of your business.  Get the keys.""
Darrell said: ""I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.""
Bobby said: ""Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?"""
"Bobby said: ""All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?""
Darrell said: ""No.""
Bobby said: ""Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it."""
"Bobby said: ""Got any cold soda?""
Woman said: ""Eh?""
Bobby said: ""Soda.  You got any soda?""
Woman said: ""Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.""
Bobby said: ""Soda.  You know."""
"Woman said: ""I call the sheriff.""
Bobby said: ""No! No police."""
"Bobby said: ""Can I give you a hand, beautiful?""
Grace said: ""I'm just going to my car?""
Bobby said: ""That's right on my way.""
Grace said: ""My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.""
Bobby said: ""My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?""
Grace said: ""Do you have to call me that?""
Bobby said: ""I don't know your real name.""
Grace said: ""Maybe I don't want you to."""
"Bobby said: ""Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.""
Grace said: ""You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?""
Bobby said: ""I like that about me, beautiful.""
Grace said: ""It's Grace.""
Bobby said: ""May I carry your package, Grace?"""
"Bobby said: ""Jesus.""
Grace said: ""You sure you can manage?""
Bobby said: ""I got it.""
Grace said: ""Do you want me to carry your pack for you?"""
"Bobby said: ""No, I've got it.""
Grace said: ""What happened to your hand?""
Bobby said: ""Accident.""
Grace said: ""You should be more careful."""
"Grace said: ""It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.""
Bobby said: ""No trouble at all, really."""
"Bobby said: ""Wasn't nothing.""
Grace said: ""Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.""
Bobby said: ""That's all right.  I got it."""
"Grace said: ""Thank you, Bobby.""
Bobby said: ""You're welcome, Grace.""
Grace said: ""You're not from around here, are you?""
Bobby said: ""Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?""
Grace said: ""You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.""
Bobby said: ""I just drove in this morning.""
Grace said: ""Drove into Superior?  What for?""
Bobby said: ""Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.""
Grace said: ""You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?""
Bobby said: ""Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.""
Grace said: ""And here I've made you all hot and sweaty."""
"Grace said: ""Where you coming from?""
Bobby said: ""All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.""
Grace said: ""You've been around.""
Bobby said: ""I guess I've got wander in my blood.""
Grace said: ""Where you headed?""
Bobby said: ""I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.""
Grace said: ""So, what is it you do, Mister...?""
Bobby said: ""Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .""
Grace said: ""I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.""
Bobby said: ""If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.""
Grace said: ""What happens when you lose?""
Bobby said: ""I pack up and go somewhere else."""
"Bobby said: ""That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.""
Grace said: ""I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.""
Bobby said: ""I didn't say it bothered me.""
Grace said: ""Did you like it; me watching you?""
Bobby said: ""I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.""
Grace said: ""Good, 'cause I liked what I saw."""
"Bobby said: ""Nice place.""
Grace said: ""Thank you."""
"Bobby said: ""Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.""
Grace said: ""I guess it must.""
Bobby said: ""What do you do anyway?""
Grace said: ""A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.""
Bobby said: ""Where'd you learn to do that?""
Grace said: ""From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.""
Bobby said: ""A medicine man?""
Grace said: ""Those are white words, not ours.""
Bobby said: ""Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.""
Grace said: ""Come here."""
"Bobby said: ""My face tell you all that?""
Grace said: ""It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?""
Bobby said: ""The same thing you do."""
"Grace said: ""There.  All done.  Lift me down.""
Bobby said: ""What?""
Grace said: ""Lift me down."""
"Grace said: ""You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?""
Bobby said: ""Like you.""
Grace said: ""Beautiful?"""
"Grace said: ""I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.""
Bobby said: ""Nothing like a little liveliness."""
"Grace said: ""No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?""
Bobby said: ""I have an idea.""
Grace said: ""And what would that be?"""
"Bobby said: ""You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.""
Grace said: ""Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?"""
"Bobby said: ""I think I can find my own way back to into town.""
Grace said: ""Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.""
Bobby said: ""I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade."""
"Grace said: ""You never did answer my question.""
Bobby said: ""Still playing?""
Grace said: ""That's not an answer.  What is it you want?""
Bobby said: ""You know what I want.""
Grace said: ""Maybe I just want to hear you say it."""
"Bobby said: ""Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...""
Grace said: ""How do you know he's still not here?""
Bobby said: ""Guys like me take those chances. Let's go."""
"Bobby said: ""Are there snakes out here?""
Grace said: ""They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.""
Bobby said: ""Doesn't the isolation bother you?""
Grace said: ""Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.""
Bobby said: ""You love him?""
Grace said: ""No.""
Bobby said: ""Did you ever?""
Grace said: ""Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.""
Bobby said: ""Is that why you're with him?""
Grace said: ""I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?""
Bobby said: ""I'm guessing no.""
Grace said: ""Yeah, I guess you're right.""
Bobby said: ""I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.""
Grace said: ""I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?"""
"Grace said: ""All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.""
Bobby said: ""You could leave him.""
Grace said: ""I don't know how.""
Bobby said: ""Walk away.""
Grace said: ""It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.""
Bobby said: ""You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.""
Grace said: ""Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out."""
"Bobby said: ""What's the matter?...Grace?""
Grace said: ""Nothing.""
Bobby said: ""Don't feel like nothing."""
"Grace said: ""Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.""
Bobby said: ""Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.""
Grace said: ""You'd never understand.""
Bobby said: ""Try me.""
Grace said: ""It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...""
Bobby said: ""Nothing I understand better than a mess."""
"Bobby said: ""You mean the Shaman?""
Grace said: ""He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his ""little halfbreed""... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?"""
"Bobby said: ""Yeah.""
Grace said: ""You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away."""
"Grace said: ""After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...""
Bobby said: ""I'm sorry...""
Grace said: ""Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?""
Bobby said: ""Yeah."""
"Bobby said: ""Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.""
Grace said: ""Is it pretty?""
Bobby said: ""Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see."""
"Grace said: ""Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.""
Bobby said: ""Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...""
Grace said: ""Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...""
Bobby said: ""You don't have any money put away, do you?""
Grace said: ""Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...""
Bobby said: ""...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here."""
"Bobby said: ""Where?""
Grace said: ""Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.""
Bobby said: ""What do you mean?""
Grace said: ""At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more."""
"Bobby said: ""In <u>cash</u>?""
Grace said: ""Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...""
Bobby said: ""One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch."""
"Grace said: ""It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.""
Bobby said: ""If the key's on him, how do we get the key?""
Grace said: ""Kill him."""
"Bobby said: ""I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.""
Grace said: ""It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and..."""
"Bobby said: ""I wanted to talk.""
Grace said: ""I don't think we have anything to talk about.""
Bobby said: ""What about us?""
Grace said: ""There is no us, remember?""
Bobby said: ""Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.""
Grace said: ""Stop it.""
Bobby said: ""Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?""
Grace said: ""Because I know you're full of shit.""
Bobby said: ""I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.""
Grace said: ""I thought you couldn't get your car.""
Bobby said: ""I could if I had Jake's money.""
Grace said: ""Is that what changed your mind?  The money?""
Bobby said: ""I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that."""
"Grace said: ""Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?""
Bobby said: ""I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.""
Grace said: ""You said you couldn't kill anybody.""
Bobby said: ""We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird."""
"Bobby said: ""Grace ... Grace?""
Grace said: ""After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked."""
"Grace said: ""The money's right here! Get the key!""
Bobby said: ""No! You get it!"""
"Grace said: ""Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?""
Bobby said: ""I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.""
Grace said: ""I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.""
Bobby said: ""Good thinking.  What's all this?""
Grace said: ""I'm not coming back."""
"Bobby said: ""I can't see it.""
Grace said: ""It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!"""
"Bobby said: ""Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?""
Grace said: ""You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.""
Bobby said: ""I don't know about that?""
Grace said: ""You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.""
Bobby said: ""We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.""
Grace said: ""Can't we just dump him fast someplace?""
Bobby said: ""I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.""
Grace said: ""Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?""
Bobby said: ""I'm not sailing his boat.""
Grace said: ""But I thought --""
Bobby said: ""We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.""
Grace said: ""Anywhere?""
Bobby said: ""What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?""
Grace said: ""Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.""
Bobby said: ""You already have."""
"Bobby said: ""You know I thought you'd left me back there.""
Grace said: ""What are you talking about?"""
"Grace said: ""Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.""
Bobby said: ""He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...""
Grace said: ""The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.""
Bobby said: ""He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...""
Grace said: ""He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same."""
"Grace said: ""So, aren't you going to ask me?""
Bobby said: ""Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?""
Grace said: ""Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?""
Bobby said: ""Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...""
Grace said: ""Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?"""
"Bobby said: ""Why?""
Grace said: ""<u>I don't know why</u>!"""
"Bobby said: ""No Grace, my hand's bothering me.""
Grace said: ""You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!"""
"Grace said: ""Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?""
Bobby said: ""You could give me my gun back."""
"Bobby said: ""I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.""
Grace said: ""You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?""
Bobby said: ""I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds."""
"Bobby said: ""Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.""
Grace said: ""Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.""
Bobby said: ""Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?""
Grace said: ""I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!""
Bobby said: ""You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?"""
"Bobby said: ""When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.""
Grace said: ""I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?""
Bobby said: ""I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared..."""
"Bobby said: ""Time to go for a walk, Jake.""
Grace said: ""My mother died in this canyon.""
Bobby said: ""Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three..."""
"Grace said: ""Hope is a four-letter word.""
Bobby said: ""But we all need that too. Hold him."""
"Bobby said: ""Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.""
Grace said: ""Bobby? Are you all right?""
Bobby said: ""I busted my leg!""
Grace said: ""Can you make it back up?""
Bobby said: ""Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down."""
"Grace said: ""Why's that?""
Bobby said: ""'Cause I love you."""
"Grace said: ""And I love you too.""
Bobby said: ""And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you..."""
"Grace said: ""<u>Jake</u>...""
Bobby said: ""He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!"""
"Bobby said: ""Morning, officer.""
Sheriff said: ""Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup."""
"Sheriff said: ""Where ya goin'?""
Bobby said: ""Harlin's.""
Sheriff said: ""Get in."""
"Sheriff said: ""Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?""
Bobby said: ""No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.""
Sheriff said: ""That's a nasty cut you got there.""
Bobby said: ""Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.""
Sheriff said: ""There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.""
Bobby said: ""Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road."""
"Mr. Arkady said: ""That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.""
Bobby said: ""And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...""
Mr. Arkady said: """"Arkady""""
Bobby said: ""Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!""
Mr. Arkady said: ""...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.""
Bobby said: ""No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.""
Mr. Arkady said: ""The old lady?""
Bobby said: ""With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?"""
"Bobby said: ""Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.""
Mr. Arkady said: ""Which you don't have.""
Bobby said: ""But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh..."""
"Bobby said: ""Yeah, if you could send it care of...""
Mr. Arkady said: ""...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.""
Bobby said: ""A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.""
Mr. Arkady said: ""A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is."""
"Mr. Arkady said: ""What'd you say to me!""
Bobby said: ""Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here."""
"Bobby said: ""I need a ticket.""
Clerk said: ""Where to?""
Bobby said: ""Out of here.""
Clerk said: ""But, in particular?""
Bobby said: ""I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.""
Clerk said: ""Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--""
Bobby said: ""I don't care, just get me there."""
"Clerk said: ""How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.""
Bobby said: ""How much?""
Clerk said: ""One way, or round trip?""
Bobby said: ""One way.""
Clerk said: ""30.55. Twenty more will get you back."""
"Bobby said: ""Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.""
Clerk said: ""The ticket is 30.55."""
"Clerk said: ""Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.""
Bobby said: ""I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ..."""
"Bobby said: ""You got a beer?""
Flo said: ""What kind?""
Bobby said: ""Beck's.""
Flo said: ""No Beck's. A-1, Coors...""
Bobby said: ""Heineken?""
Flo said: ""No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.""
Bobby said: ""Genuine Draft?""
Flo said: ""No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.""
Bobby said: ""I'll fuckin' take it. To go."""
"Flo said: ""Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?""
Bobby said: ""Sure, I'll try."""
"Flo said: ""My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.""
Sheriff said: ""What was that all about?""
Flo said: ""You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.""
Sheriff said: ""More like Jenny is after every man she sees."""
"Flo said: ""Let me get your change.""
Sheriff said: ""Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee."""
"Sheriff said: ""Son of a bitch!""
Flo said: ""Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?""
Sheriff said: ""I think I burned my gun hand!"""
"Sheriff said: ""Morning Grace.""
Grace said: ""Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.""
Sheriff said: ""Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too."""
"Grace said: ""Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.""
Sheriff said: ""Oh?"""
"Grace said: ""Anybody hurt?""
Sheriff said: ""Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son."""
"Sheriff said: ""You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?""
Grace said: ""No baby, you got it wrong.""
Sheriff said: ""This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?"""
"Sheriff said: ""I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?""
Grace said: ""You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you."""
"Grace said: ""Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!""
Sheriff said: ""...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!"""
"Jake said: ""Who was that on the phone?""
Grace said: ""Wrong number.""
Jake said: ""You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?"""
"Grace said: ""I put up new drapes, Jake.""
Jake said: ""I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?""
Grace said: ""You never said anything.  About the drapes.""
Jake said: ""They look nice.""
Grace said: ""You haven't even looked at them once."""
"Jake said: ""They look nice.""
Grace said: ""I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors."""
"Jake said: ""What the hell you looking at, girl?""
Grace said: ""Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing."""
"Jake said: ""Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.""
Grace said: ""Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.""
Jake said: ""You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!""
Grace said: ""Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!""
Jake said: ""You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.""
Grace said: ""No! No! Please!"""
"Grace said: ""What's the matter?""
Jake said: ""You didn't hear something?""
Grace said: ""Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.""

Sergei said: ""I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?""
Sheriff said: ""What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything..."""
"Sheriff said: ""What's that?  ...""concealed"" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?""
Sergei said: ""What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police..."""
"Sheriff said: ""Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.""
Sergei said: ""I want my lawyer!"""
"Ancient Secretary said: ""Yes?""
David said: ""Is Noel in?""
Ancient Secretary said: ""No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.""
David said: ""Oh.""
Ancient Secretary said: ""I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.""
David said: ""Wow.""
Ancient Secretary said: ""I had to put him down."""
"Ancient Secretary said: ""Proceed.""
David said: ""Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?"""
"Ancient Secretary said: ""Is that the entire message?""
David said: ""Yes."""
"Business Man said: ""Wrap it up.""
Elijah said: ""You've made a considerably wise decision."""
"Elijah said: ""Once again please?""
Business Man said: ""My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.""
Elijah said: ""How old is Jeb?""
Business Man said: ""Four.""
Elijah said: ""No."""
"Elijah said: ""No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.""
Business Man said: ""What did I say?""
Elijah said: ""Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time..."""
"Elijah said: ""I'm listening.""
Business Man said: ""I'll keep it in my office room.""
Elijah said: ""What about Jeb?""
Business Man said: ""I have a lock on the door."""
"David said: ""I don't think I got the job in New York.""
Megan said: ""What does that mean?""
David said: ""I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.""
Megan said: ""I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.""
David said: ""I know."""
"Megan said: ""Is Jeremy okay?""
David said: ""He's asleep.""
Megan said: ""Oh."""
"Megan said: ""I don't know. It's been a while.""
David said: ""I haven't been sick this year. I know that.""
Megan said: ""Okay.""
David said: ""Do you remember me getting sick?""
Megan said: ""Not a specific day. What's this about?""
David said: ""Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?"""
"Megan said: ""...I can't remember.""
David said: ""That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?""
Megan said: ""It means we're probably to tired to remember."""
"Megan said: ""Is that what you wanted to ask me?""
David said: ""Yes.""
Megan said: ""Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.""
David said: ""No that's it."""
"David said: ""When was the last time I wore pink?""
Megan said: ""The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.""
David said: ""Oh shit...""
Megan said: ""Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal."""
"Megan said: ""I've come to a decision.""
David said: ""Oh."""
"David said: ""Megan?""
Megan said: ""Yes. Is this David?""
David said: ""Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?""
Megan said: ""My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together."""
"David said: ""I remember you.""
Megan said: ""I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together."""
"David said: ""...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?""
Megan said: ""Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear."""
"David said: ""What do I do when I'm around someone I know?""
Megan said: ""You use your sleeve."""
"Megan said: ""He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.""
David said: ""He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself."""
"David said: ""Would you like to try going--""
Megan said: ""Yes.""
David said: ""out again?"""
"Megan said: ""Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.""
David said: ""Jesus."""
"Megan said: ""He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.""
David said: ""Jeremy what the hell are you doing?"""
"David said: ""...I think rust.""
Megan said: ""Rust?""
David said: ""As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?"""
"Megan said: ""I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.""
David said: ""My turn. What's your favorite song?""
Megan said: ""Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.""
David said: ""What was that?""
Megan said: ""We're supposed to be honest."""
"David said: ""Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.""
Megan said: ""My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?"""
"David said: ""I'm not sure.""
Megan said: ""Think carefully?""
David said: ""What about the game?""
Megan said: ""It's finished. I won."""
"Megan said: ""Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--""
David said: ""I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?""
Megan said: ""That counts."""
"Megan said: ""Why?""
David said: ""I don't know Megan.""
Megan said: ""It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have."""
"Elijah said: ""You've never been sick?""
David said: ""I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so."""
"Elijah said: ""How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?""
David said: ""Seventy-five percent.""
Elijah said: ""Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.""
David said: ""Skeptical about what?""
Elijah said: ""Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level."""
"Elijah said: ""What's he talking about?""
David said: ""In college. A car accident.""
Elijah said: ""Was it serious?"""
"Elijah said: ""I assumed because of the train.""
David said: ""You assumed wrong."""
"David said: ""You forgot the ""Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on"" step. See usually that comes before the, ""It's over"" Step. And it always, always comes before the ""You can go"" Step.  What is over?""
Elijah said: ""The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head."""
"Elijah said: ""This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.""
David said: ""What was your idea Elijah?"""
"David said: ""At the church... You were following me weren't you?""
Elijah said: ""Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you."""
"David said: ""What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?""
Elijah said: ""You've misunderstood.""
David said: ""I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'"""
"David said: ""It's for last week's game.""
Elijah said: ""I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot."""
"David said: ""What do you want?""
Elijah said: ""Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.""
David said: ""We're not proceeding anywhere together.""
Elijah said: ""We've already begun."""
"Elijah said: ""Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?""
David said: ""Are you for real?""
Elijah said: ""You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number."""
"David said: ""Just give me a minute.""
Elijah said: ""Is there a problem?""
David said: ""That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line."""
"David said: ""I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.""
Elijah said: ""How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?""
David said: ""Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.""
Elijah said: ""You thought he was carrying a knife?"""
"David said: ""I thought he was carrying something.""
Elijah said: ""But not a knife?""
David said: ""I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v."""
"Elijah said: ""You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?""
David said: ""Like what?""
Elijah said: ""Telling when people have done something wrong?"""
"David said: ""Yes.""
Elijah said: ""Have you ever tried to develop it?""
David said: ""I don't know what you're asking?""
Elijah said: ""You're skill."""
"David said: ""Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--""
Elijah said: ""Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort."""
"David said: ""Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.""
Elijah said: ""It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.""
David said: ""The guy might not have been carrying anything.""
Elijah said: ""Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants."""
"David said: ""I have to go now.""
Elijah said: ""One last question."""
"David said: ""Quick.""
Elijah said: ""The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?"""
"David said: ""I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.""
Elijah said: ""That's not what I witnessed David.""
David said: ""Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.""
Elijah said: ""I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.""
David said: ""You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it."""
"Elijah said: ""Are you finished?""
David said: ""No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do."""
"Elijah'S Mother said: ""I am. I'm helping him with the sale.""
David said: ""It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.""
Elijah'S Mother said: ""He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.""
David said: ""We are."""
"David said: ""He's doing well today.""
Elijah'S Mother said: ""I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.""
David said: ""He's kind of a miracle.""
Elijah'S Mother said: ""Yes he is."""
"Walkie said: ""Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.""
David said: ""What's he look like?""
Walkie said: ""He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.""
David said: ""Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.""
Walkie said: ""Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit."""
"David said: ""Yeah?""
Walkie said: ""There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt."""
"David said: ""When?""
Walkie said: ""Just now. They want you to come down to his school."""
"David said: ""Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?""
Jeremy said: ""I want to sleep here tonight.""
David said: ""I think it's be better if I was alone.""
Jeremy said: ""I won't make any noise.""
David said: ""How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?"""
"Jeremy said: ""He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--""
David said: ""In under six seconds.  I've heard."""
"David said: ""I'm going to go in.""
Jeremy said: ""Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.""
David said: ""Why'd you do that?""
Jeremy said: ""Just one--""
David said: ""Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.""
Jeremy said: ""What things?""
David said: ""I'm going to work out.""
Jeremy said: ""I'll help you.""
David said: ""There's nothing to do."""
"Jeremy said: ""You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?""
David said: ""No.""
Jeremy said: ""What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?""
David said: ""No.""
Jeremy said: ""What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?"""
"David said: ""You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.""
Jeremy said: ""How much can you lift?"""
"David said: ""No.""
Jeremy said: ""I mean if you knew karate?""
David said: ""No Jeremy.""
Jeremy said: ""What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?"""
"David said: ""How much did you take off?""
Jeremy said: ""I lied."""
"Jeremy said: ""How much is it?""
David said: ""Two hundred and seventy."""
"David said: ""What do you do if something happens?""
Jeremy said: ""Get mom."""
"David said: ""How many did you put on that time?""
Jeremy said: ""All of it.""
David said: ""There's no more left?"""
"Jeremy said: ""I'm sleeping in my room.""
David said: ""I see.""
Jeremy said: ""I'm not scared.""
David said: ""That's great.""
Jeremy said: ""Do you know why?"""
"Jeremy said: ""I know now.""
David said: ""Know what?""
Jeremy said: ""You're secret identity.  That man was right."""
"Jeremy said: ""YOU WON'T GET HURT...""
David said: ""Elijah was wrong."""
"David said: ""That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.""
Jeremy said: ""You're lying.""
David said: ""I'm not. I just didn't connect it."""
"Jeremy said: ""I'll just shoot him once.""
David said: ""Jeremy listen to what--"""
"Jeremy said: ""Don't be scared.""
David said: ""Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York."""
"David said: ""You like sports?""
Woman said: ""It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.""
David said: ""What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.""
Woman said: ""Is that right?""
David said: ""But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit."""
"David said: ""You represent someone in Philadelphia?""
Woman said: ""I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?"""
"David said: ""Not really.""
Woman said: ""This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God."""
"David said: ""Yeah, hello.""
Woman said: ""Is David Dunne there?"""
"David said: ""He doesn't look very threatening.""
Woman said: ""That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind."""
"Man In Scrubs said: ""How are you feeling?""
David said: ""Okay."""
"Man In Scrubs said: ""You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?""
David said: ""Fine."""
"Man In Scrubs said: ""Where were you sitting on the train?""
David said: ""Against a window.""
Man In Scrubs said: ""In the passenger car?""
David said: ""Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?""
Man In Scrubs said: ""Was your family traveling with you?""
David said: ""No.""
Man In Scrubs said: ""Did you get up from your seat?""
David said: ""No."""
"Megan said: ""We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.""
Elijah said: ""How long have you been married?"""
"Megan said: ""Twelve years.""
Elijah said: ""How did you get together?"""
"Elijah said: ""Now you're going to have to tell me more.""
Megan said: ""...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.""
Elijah said: ""How so?""
Megan said: ""Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.""
Elijah said: ""You and my mother would have a special connection.""
Megan said: ""Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.""
Elijah said: ""...And everyone lived happily ever after."""
"Elijah said: ""There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.""
Megan said: ""And what was that explanation?"""
"Megan said: ""Is this a religious thing?""
Elijah said: ""I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.""
Megan said: ""For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.""
Elijah said: ""I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals."""
"Elijah'S Mother said: ""No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.""
Elijah said: ""I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.""
Elijah'S Mother said: ""You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room."""
"Elijah'S Mother said: ""...I got a present for you.""
Elijah said: ""Why?""
Elijah'S Mother said: ""Forget why. Do you want it or not?"""
"Elijah'S Mother said: ""Well, go get it then.""
Elijah said: ""Where is it?""
Elijah'S Mother said: ""On a bench, across the street."""

"Little Bill said: ""Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.""
English Bob said: ""Shit and fried eggs.""
Little Bill said: ""Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?""
English Bob said: ""Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.""
Little Bill said: ""Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it."""
"English Bob said: ""What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.""
Little Bill said: ""I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?""
English Bob said: ""WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... ""friends."""""
"English Bob said: ""Books. He's my biographer.""
Little Bill said: ""Oh."""
"English Bob said: ""Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?""
Little Bill said: ""I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around."""
"Little Bill said: ""Charley, see what kind of ""books"" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.""
English Bob said: ""Be careful with those, sonny."""
"English Bob said: ""You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.""
Little Bill said: ""Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?"""
"English Bob said: ""Mmmm pistols.""
Little Bill said: ""Oh yeah."""
"Fuzzy said: ""We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...""
Little Bill said: ""Alive?""
Fuzzy said: ""Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...""
Little Bill said: ""He admit it?""
Fuzzy said: ""No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...""
Little Bill said: ""Those cowboys messin' him up?""
Fuzzy said: ""Uh... a little, maybe.""
Little Bill said: ""You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went."""
"Skinny said: ""Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.""
Little Bill said: ""No?""
Skinny said: ""This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.""
Little Bill said: ""Property.""
Skinny said: ""Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.""
Little Bill said: ""You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.""
Skinny said: ""Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it."""
"Skinny said: ""She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.""
Little Bill said: ""You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?"""
"Skinny said: ""Hit your finger, huh?""
Little Bill said: ""Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?""
Skinny said: ""Heard you done the roof yourself.""
Little Bill said: ""Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.""
Skinny said: ""What's all that wood?""
Little Bill said: ""Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set."""
"Little Bill said: ""Yeah?""
Skinny said: ""Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...""
Little Bill said: ""Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.""
Skinny said: ""...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah."""
"Little Bill said: ""An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?""
Skinny said: ""Yup.""
Little Bill said: ""All week?""
Skinny said: ""I didn't hear nothin' till last night.""
Little Bill said: ""Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.""
Skinny said: ""Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.""
Little Bill said: ""They really got all that money, them whores?""
Skinny said: ""You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe.""
Little Bill said: ""That much, huh?""
Skinny said: ""You could run off them two cowboys.""
Little Bill said: ""I could run off them whores.""
Skinny said: ""Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.""
Little Bill said: ""Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends."""
"Munny said: ""Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.""
Little Bill said: ""Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.""
Munny said: ""Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.""
Little Bill said: ""Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?""
Munny said: ""I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.""
Little Bill said: ""You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.""
Munny said: ""Like I said, I...""
Little Bill said: ""What's your name?""
Munny said: ""Uh, William... uh... Hendershot."""
"Little Bill said: ""Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?""
Munny said: ""I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed."""
"Little Bill said: ""I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.""
Munny said: ""Uh... yeah. Yeah.""
Little Bill said: ""There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.""
Munny said: ""Well, uh... it ain't loaded."""
"Munny said: ""He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.""
Little Bill said: ""I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.""
Munny said: ""I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys."""
"Little Bill said: ""I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.""
Munny said: """"Deserve"" don't mean shit, Little Bill.""
Little Bill said: ""I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole."""
"Little Bill said: ""You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?""
Ww said: ""N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...""
Little Bill said: ""Letters?"""
"Ww said: ""It's only a b-b-b-book...""
Little Bill said: ""A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?"""
"Little Bill said: ""The... Duck of Death.""
Ww said: ""D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death."""
"Little Bill said: ""That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?""
Ww said: ""Uh... Duke."""
"Ww said: ""Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.""
Little Bill said: ""Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.""
Ww said: ""Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...""
Little Bill said: ""Meaning the duck himself, I guess.""
Ww said: ""Duke.""
Little Bill said: ""Duck, I says.  ""You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran,"" said the duck. ""You must apologize."" But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns.""""
Ww said: ""I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...""
Little Bill said: ""Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.""
Ww said: ""You were there?"""
"Little Bill said: ""First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.""
Ww said: ""But he was called...""
Little Bill said: ""Some folks did call Old Corky ""Two Gun"" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell."""
"Little Bill said: ""Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...""
Ww said: ""And?""
Little Bill said: ""Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.""
Ww said: ""You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?""
Little Bill said: ""Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver."""
"Ww said: ""But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...""
Little Bill said: ""He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.""
Ww said: ""But... if he doesn't miss?""
Little Bill said: ""Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?"""
"Little Bill said: ""Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.""
Ww said: ""Is... is it... loaded?""
Little Bill said: ""Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though."""
"Ww said: ""R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?""
Little Bill said: ""Give it to him."""
"Little Bill said: """"Well, Jim,"" I says, ""it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby.""""
Ww said: ""Did you... kill him?""
Little Bill said: ""No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character."""
"Little Bill said: ""I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...""
Ww said: ""Uh... Sheriff... Uh...""
Little Bill said: ""Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.""
Ww said: ""Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.""
Little Bill said: ""What?""
Ww said: ""Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I..."""
"Munny said: ""I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.""
Little Sue said: ""Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them."""

Munny said: ""Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...""
Little Sue said: ""He's... he's dead.""
Munny said: ""No he ain't. He went South yesterday.""
Little Sue said: ""They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...""
Munny said: ""Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?"""
"Munny said: ""Who killed him?""
Little Sue said: ""Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...""
Munny said: ""He hanged him?  Shot him down?""
Little Sue said: ""N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.""
Munny said: ""Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.""
Little Sue said: ""They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.""
Munny said: ""A sign on him?""
Little Sue said: ""In front of Greely's. It says, ""This here is what happens to...""""
Munny said: ""They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?"""
"Munny said: ""The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?""
Little Sue said: ""About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...""
Munny said: ""What'd Ned say?""
Little Sue said: ""L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...""
Munny said: ""Then... what?""
Little Sue said: ""A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...""
Munny said: ""An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?""
Little Sue said: ""Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was..."""
"Little Sue said: ""He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said ""Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?"" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.""
Munny said: ""Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?""
Little Sue said: ""N-no, sir?""
Munny said: ""Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid."""
"Munny said: ""William Munny, yeah.""
The Kid said: ""Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?"""
"The Kid said: ""You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...""

Munny said: ""About what?""
The Kid said: ""Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.""
Munny said: ""What for?""
The Kid said: ""For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.""
Munny said: ""Jesus!""
The Kid said: ""Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece."""
"Munny said: ""I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.""

Munny said: ""Been gone near three years now.""
The Kid said: ""Oh."""

Ned said: ""We'll bury him.""

Rab In said: ""The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.""
Kujan said: ""Did they charge him with anything?"""
"Rab In said: ""Weapons. Misdemeanor two.""
Kujan said: ""What'the fuck is that?"""
"Kujan said: ""When does he post bail?""
Rab In said: ""Two hours, tops.""
Kujan said: ""I want to see him."""

Kujan said: ""Someplace else, then.""
Rab In said: ""Where?"""
"Kujan said: ""I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.""
Rab In said: ""Which is shit.""
Kujan said: ""No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.""
Rab In said: ""Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.""
Kujan said: ""I'11 find him.""
Rab In said: ""Waste of time.""
Kujan said: ""A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.""
Rab In said: ""What?""
Kujan said: ""Nothing. Something I - forget it."""
"Rabin said: ""Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired""
Kujan said: ""This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time."""
"Rabin said: ""No, no, no, no, no.""
Kujan said: ""If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?""
Rabin said: ""And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.""
Kujan said: ""You know damn well what I think."""
"Rabin said: ""That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.""
Kujan said: ""I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead."""
"Rabin said: ""His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.""
Kujan said: ""Kobayashi."""
"Kujan said: ""Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.""
Verbal said: ""Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -""
Kujan said: ""Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.""
Verbal said: ""I told the D.A. everything I know."""
"Kujan said: ""I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.""
Verbal said: ""I know he was good.""
Kujan said: ""He was a corrupt cop, Verbal."""
"Verbal said: ""Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.""
Kujan said: ""Keaton was a piece of shit."""
"Verbal said: ""You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?""
Kujan said: ""I just want to hear your story."""
"Kujan said: ""According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.""
Verbal said: ""That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.""
Kujan said: ""Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .""
Verbal said: ""Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.""
Kujan said: ""You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?""
Verbal said: ""You know a religious guy named John Paul?""
Kujan said: ""You know Ruby is in Attica?""
Verbal said: ""He didn't have my lawyer.""
Kujan said: ""I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much."""
"Verbal said: ""There's nothing in there about Ruby.""
Kujan said: ""I'11 be sure to mention that to him."""
"Kujan said: ""The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?""
Verbal said: ""No.""
Kujan said: ""I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.""
Verbal said: ""I'm not a rat."""
"Kujan said: ""Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.""
Verbal said: ""You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.""
Kujan said: ""Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.""
Verbal said: ""He loved her.""
Kujan said: ""Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea"""
"Verbal said: ""That was all Fenster and McManus.""
Kujan said: ""Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service"""
"Verbal said: ""You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +""
Kujan said: ""Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +""
Verbal said: ""You got him wrong.""
Kujan said: ""Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either."""
"Verbal said: ""I don't know about that.""
Kujan said: ""I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.""
Verbal said: ""He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.""
Kujan said: ""What lawyer?"""
"Kujan said: ""You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.""
Verbal said: ""The D.A. gave me immunity.""
Kujan said: ""NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,"""
"Verbal said: ""There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.""
Kujan said: ""Is he the one that killed Keaton?""
Verbal said: ""No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.""
Kujan said: ""Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT.

"Kujan said: ""So this lawyer...""
Verbal said: ""Kobayashi.""
Kujan said: ""Came from Redfoot.""
Verbal said: ""Right.""
Kujan said: ""And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?"""
"Kujan said: ""Do you believe in him, Verbal?""
Verbal said: ""Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE."""
"Verbal said: ""I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.""
Kujan said: ""And this is why you never told the D.A.""
Verbal said: ""You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?""
Kujan said: ""Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out."""
"Verbal said: ""I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?""
Kujan said: ""If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.""
Verbal said: ""Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.""
Kujan said: ""So why play into his hands? We can protect you.""
Verbal said: ""Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again."""
"Verbal said: ""That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.""
Kujan said: ""This is totally irrelevant.""
Verbal said: ""Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.""
Kujan said: ""Can we just get back to Kobayashi?""
Verbal said: ""The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us."""
"Kujan said: ""You're stalling, Verbal.""
Verbal said: ""Give a guy a break, huh?""
Kujan said: ""What happened?"""
"Kujan said: ""Then what?""
Verbal said: ""McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.""
Kujan said: ""What call?""
Verbal said: ""Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster."""
"Verbal said: ""I wanted to. I thought we could make it.""
Kujan said: ""Why didn't you say anything?""
Verbal said: ""I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's"""
"Kujan said: ""A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.""
Verbal said: ""Wait a minute.""
Kujan said: ""I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was."""
"Kujan said: ""Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.""
Verbal said: ""I don't.""
Kujan said: ""YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON ."""
"Kujan said: ""TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .""
Verbal said: ""I don't know what you're talking about.""
Kujan said: ""YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME."""
"Verbal said: ""I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.""
Kujan said: ""Then why didn't you help him?""
Verbal said: ""I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.""
Kujan said: ""But Keaton...""
Verbal said: ""It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?"""
"Kujan said: ""He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.""
Verbal said: ""I never heard of him.""
Kujan said: ""His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.""
Verbal said: ""I said I never heard of him."""
"Kujan said: ""But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.""
Verbal said: ""I don't""
Kujan said: ""There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.""
Verbal said: ""But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?"""
"Kujan said: ""Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?""
Verbal said: ""He wanted me to live.""
Kujan said: ""Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'""
Verbal said: ""Edie.""
Kujan said: ""I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?""
Verbal said: ""Because he was my friend.""
Kujan said: ""No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will."""
"Verbal said: ""No...""
Kujan said: ""Keaton was Keyser Soze""
Verbal said: ""NO."""
"Verbal said: ""NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.""
Kujan said: ""THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN."""
"Verbal said: ""Edie...""
Kujan said: ""He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.""
Verbal said: ""This is all bullshit.""
Kujan said: ""He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.""
Verbal said: ""I knew him. He would never -""
Kujan said: ""He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been"""
"Kujan said: ""If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.""
Verbal said: ""It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning."""
"Verbal said: ""I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ""
Kujan said: ""Why lie about everything else, then?""
Verbal said: ""You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't"""
"Kujan said: ""You're not safe on your own.""
Verbal said: ""You think he's..?""
Kujan said: ""Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.""
Verbal said: ""I'm not bait. No way. I post today.""
Kujan said: ""You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.""
Verbal said: ""I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.""
Kujan said: ""Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.""
Verbal said: ""Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's"""

Concannon said: ""How is that?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""Through, through his book.""
Concannon said: ""What book is that?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""Meth...Methodology and Technique...""
Concannon said: ""...of Anesthesiology?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.""
Concannon said: ""How old are you?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""I am seventy-four years old.""
Concannon said: ""Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""I'm on the staff of...""
Concannon said: ""Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.""
Concannon said: ""Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine."""
"Dr. Thompson said: ""I did.""
Concannon said: ""Objection."""
"Concannon said: ""Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.""
Judge said: ""Huh!""
Concannon said: ""My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way."""
"Judge said: ""Mr. Concannon...?""
Concannon said: ""Nothing further, your Honor.""
Judge said: ""Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?"""
"Concannon said: ""Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...""
Judge said: ""I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed."""
"Concannon said: ""No further questions.""
Judge said: ""You may step down."""
"Concannon said: ""Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.""
Judge said: ""...one moment, Mr. Concannon..."""
"Judge said: ""The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...""
Concannon said: ""Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.""
Judge said: ""I'm going to uphold that."""
"Concannon said: ""You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?""
Kathy said: ""It's a crime.""
Concannon said: ""Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.""
Kathy said: ""I wouldn't do it.""
Concannon said: ""You would not...?""
Kathy said: ""No.""
Concannon said: ""In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?""
Kathy said: ""Yes.""
Concannon said: ""Just now...""
Kathy said: ""Yes.""
Concannon said: ""...sworn before God you would tell the truth?""
Kathy said: ""Yes.""
Concannon said: ""Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?""
Kathy said: ""I . . ..""
Concannon said: ""And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?""
Kathy said: ""I...yes.""
Concannon said: ""Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?""
Kathy said: ""I...""
Concannon said: ""You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names."""
"Kathy said: ""They lied.""
Concannon said: ""`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?""
Kathy said: ""I do.  Yes.""
Concannon said: ""You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.""
Kathy said: ""That's not my handwriting.""
Concannon said: ""You've just said you signed it.""
Kathy said: ""Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.""
Concannon said: ""You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?""
Kathy said: ""Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here."""
"Concannon said: ""...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?""
Kathy said: ""I thought I would need it.""
Concannon said: ""And why, please tell us, would you think that?""
Kathy said: ""After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse..."""
"Galvin said: ""Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.""
Doneghy said: ""... that's all right.""
Galvin said: ""I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here."""
"Doneghy said: ""...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...""
Galvin said: ""I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...""
Doneghy said: ""... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.""
Galvin said: ""I completely understand ...""
Doneghy said: ""We just ..."""
"Doneghy said: ""What is this going to cost?""
Galvin said: ""It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ..."""
"Doneghy said: ""You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?""
Galvin said: ""Hold on a second.""
Doneghy said: ""I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?"""
"Galvin said: ""It's all right, Mickey.""
Doneghy said: ""You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.""
Galvin said: ""I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...""
Doneghy said: ""What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...""
Galvin said: ""I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.""
Doneghy said: ""You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives."""
"Galvin said: ""If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.""
Doneghy said: ""I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred."""
"Dr. Thompson said: ""They gave her the wrong anesthetic.""
Mickey said: ""Why is that?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...""
Mickey said: ""...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...""
Dr. Thompson said: ""...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.""
Mickey said: ""Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""I am seventy-four years old.""
Mickey said: ""What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""I am on the staff of...""
Mickey said: ""Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...""
Dr. Thompson said: ""...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I..."""
"Mickey said: ""She getting good care over there?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...""
Mickey said: ""Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""'Code Blue'...""
Mickey said: ""It's a common medical term."""
"Judge said: ""Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""Well..."""
"Dr. Thompson said: ""I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'""
Judge said: ""Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.""
Judge said: ""The Doctors were not negligent.""
Dr. Thompson said: ""I...um..."""
"Galvin said: ""Dr. Thompson...?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""It was good of you to meet..."""
"Galvin said: ""I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...""
Dr. Thompson said: ""That's what I'd planned to...""
Galvin said: ""I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...""
Dr. Thompson said: ""From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...""
Galvin said: ""Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...""
Dr. Thompson said: ""...I made a reservation at...""
Galvin said: ""...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...""
Dr. Thompson said: ""...What difference would...""
Galvin said: ""These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...""
Dr. Thompson said: ""There's nothing they can do to me."""
"Galvin said: ""Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.""
Galvin said: ""Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?""
Dr. Thompson said: ""It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage."""
"Dr. Thompson said: ""I didn't do too well for you.""
Galvin said: ""No, you did fine.""
Dr. Thompson said: ""I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?""
Galvin said: ""No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.""
Dr. Thompson said: ""You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.""
Galvin said: ""Yes...I...yes."""
"Dr. Thompson said: ""You sure you don't want me to stay on.""
Galvin said: ""No.  No.  Thank you. You go home."""
"Galvin said: ""Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?""
Dr. Towler said: ""Yes.  I wrote it."""
"Galvin said: ""'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?""
Dr. Towler said: ""I.  Yes.  It is.""
Galvin said: ""And you wrote that...""
Dr. Towler said: ""Yes.""
Galvin said: ""...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?""
Dr. Towler said: ""She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.""
Galvin said: ""If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?""
Dr. Towler said: ""Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.""
Galvin said: ""Thank you."""
"Galvin said: ""Dr. Gruber ...""
Gruber said: ""Yes?  Galvin, right?"""
"Galvin said: ""I appreciate--a man as busy as--""
Gruber said: ""That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?"""
"Gruber said: ""I read the hospital report on your client.""
Galvin said: ""... Deborah Ann Kaye ...""
Gruber said: ""... Deborah Ann Kaye ..."""
"Galvin said: ""They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...""
Gruber said: ""Right.  Who called?""
Galvin said: ""The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...""
Gruber said: ""... and you're going to do that?""
Galvin said: ""Yes.""
Gruber said: ""You're going to settle out of court?"""
"Galvin said: ""Yes.""
Gruber said: ""Why?"""
"Galvin said: ""Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...""
Gruber said: ""Her doctors killed her.""
Galvin said: "") I'm sorry ...?""
Gruber said: ""Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.""
Galvin said: ""Do you know who her doctors were?""
Gruber said: ""I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.""
Galvin said: ""The most respected ...""
Gruber said: ""Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?"""

"Galvin said: ""Thank you ...""
Gruber said: ""... that's perfectly all right.""
Galvin said: ""Uh, why, why are you doing this?""
Gruber said: ""To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?"""
"Galvin said: ""I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.""
Mary Rooney said: ""I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...""
Galvin said: ""I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?""
Mary Rooney said: ""No.""
Galvin said: ""He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?""
Mary Rooney said: ""...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?""
Galvin said: ""I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...""
Mary Rooney said: ""I've got nothing to say to you.""
Galvin said: ""You know what happened.""
Mary Rooney said: ""Nothing happened.""
Galvin said: ""Then why aren't you testifying for their side?"""
"Galvin said: ""I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.""
Mary Rooney said: ""And ask me what?""
Galvin said: ""Who put my client in the hospital for life.""
Mary Rooney said: ""I didn't do it, Mister.""
Galvin said: ""Who are you protecting, then?""
Mary Rooney said: ""Who says that I'm protecting anyone?""
Galvin said: ""I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?""
Mary Rooney said: ""I don't owe them a goddamn thing.""
Galvin said: ""Then why don't you testify?""
Mary Rooney said: ""You know, you're pushy, fella...""
Galvin said: ""You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...""
Mary Rooney said: ""Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores."""
"Galvin said: ""Yessir.  I'm sorry.""
Judge said: ""Why is that?""
Galvin said: ""I was held up."""
"Judge said: ""Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.""
Galvin said: ""This is a complicated case, your Honor...""
Judge said: ""I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?""
Galvin said: ""My client can't walk, your Honor.""
Judge said: ""I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you."""
"Judge said: ""That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.""
Galvin said: ""...things change.""
Judge said: ""...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...""
Galvin said: ""I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...""
Judge said: ""And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.""
Galvin said: ""I'm sure you would."""
"Judge said: ""What is it?""
Galvin said: ""Thank you for seeing me.""
Judge said: ""That's perfectly all right."""

Judge said: ""I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?"""

Galvin said: ""If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...""
Judge said: ""I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?"""
"Judge said: ""I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.""

You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.

Laura said: ""Yes."""
"Galvin said: ""Do you think it's my fault?""
Laura said: ""Isn't there something you...""
Galvin said: ""That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.""

Laura said: ""You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?""
Galvin said: ""I...""
Laura said: ""You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.""
Galvin said: ""Who told you that?""
Laura said: ""You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.""
Galvin said: ""And what makes you so tough?""
Laura said: ""Maybe I'll tell you later.""
Galvin said: ""Is there going to be a later...?""

Doctor said: ""It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.""
Midge said: ""He won't talk.""
Doctor said: ""No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.""

Scottie said: ""No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the ""old college gang""; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?"""
"Elster said: ""Not what you think. We're very happily married.""

Scottie said: ""No.""
Elster said: ""If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?""
Scottie said: ""I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.""

Elster said: ""No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?""
Scottie said: ""No.""
Elster said: ""I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...""
Scottie said: ""How often does this happen?""
Elster said: ""More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.""
Scottie said: ""Where'd she go?"""
"Elster said: ""Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.""
Scottie said: ""Well?""
Elster said: ""The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.""

Elster said: ""Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --""
Scottie said: ""I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --""

Elster said: ""All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal..."""

Elster said: ""I didn't know where she was going to lead you.""
Scottie said: ""But you knew about this.""
Elster said: ""Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair."""
"Elster said: ""Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.""
Scottie said: ""Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?""
Elster said: ""Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.""
Scottie said: ""Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.""
Elster said: ""But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.""
Scottie said: ""Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?""
Elster said: ""Nothing.""
Scottie said: ""And when she goes to those places...""
Elster said: ""She is not my wife."""
"Scottie said: ""How do you know all these things she doesn't know?""
Elster said: ""Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.""
Scottie said: ""Why did she never tell her daughter?""
Elster said: ""Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely."""
"Elster said: ""He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.""
Scottie said: ""I -- I --""
Elster said: ""No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go..."""
"Scottie said: ""Hello.""
Elster'S Voice said: ""Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.""
Scottie said: ""No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.""
Elster'S Voice said: ""What happened?""
Scottie said: ""She... went into the Bay."""
"Scottie said: ""Hello?""
Elster'S Voice said: ""Did she hurt herself?""
Scottie said: ""No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did."""
"Scottie said: ""Could I ask you a couple of questions?""
Judy said: ""What for? Who are you?""
Scottie said: ""My name is John Ferguson, and --""
Judy said: ""Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?""
Scottie said: ""No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --""
Judy said: ""Do you live here in the hotel?""
Scottie said: ""No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --""
Judy said: ""0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!"""
"Scottie said: ""No, please! I Just want to talk to you!""
Judy said: ""Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!""
Scottie said: ""I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!"""
"Scottie said: ""Just let me talk to you.""
Judy said: ""What about?""
Scottie said: ""You.""
Judy said: ""Why?"""
"Judy said: ""I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!""
Scottie said: ""You're not far wrong.""
Judy said: ""Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.""
Scottie said: ""Let me come in."""
"Judy said: ""I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.""
Scottie said: ""You won't have to.""
Judy said: ""Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper..."""
"Judy said: ""What do you want to know?""
Scottie said: ""Your name. And --""
Judy said: ""Judy Barton.""
Scottie said: ""Who you are --""
Judy said: ""Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --""
Scottie said: ""-- and how you happen to be living here.""
Judy said: ""It's a place to live, that's all.""
Scottie said: ""But you haven't lived here long.""
Judy said: ""About three years.""
Scottie said: ""No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?""
Judy said: ""I told you! Right here!""
Scottie said: ""But before! Where did you live before!?!""
Judy said: ""Salina, Kansas!"""
"Judy said: ""Listen, what is this? What do you want?""
Scottie said: ""I want to know who you are.""
Judy said: ""I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?"""
"Scottie said: ""Will you have dinner with me?""
Judy said: ""Why?""
Scottie said: ""Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...""
Judy said: ""No, you don't owe me anything.""
Scottie said: ""Then will you for me?""
Judy said: ""Dinner... and what else?""
Scottie said: ""Just dinner.""
Judy said: ""Because I remind you of her?""
Scottie said: ""Because I'd like to have dinner with you."""
"Judy said: ""Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.""
Scottie said: ""I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.""
Judy said: ""Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!""
Scottie said: ""An hour?""
Judy said: ""Mmm.""
Scottie said: ""Okay."""
"Judy said: ""Thank you again. Good-night.""
Scottie said: ""Can I see you tomorrow?""
Judy said: ""Tomorrow night? Well --""
Scottie said: ""Tomorrow morning.""
Judy said: ""Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.""
Scottie said: ""Don't go.""
Judy said: ""And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?""
Scottie said: ""I'll take care of you.""
Judy said: ""Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.""
Scottie said: ""No, Judy, you don't understand.""
Judy said: ""Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.""
Scottie said: ""No.""
Judy said: ""No? Then what?""
Scottie said: ""I just want to see you as much as I can!""
Judy said: ""As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd ""take care of me""?""
Scottie said: ""Yes.""
Judy said: ""Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...""
Scottie said: ""No.""
Judy said: ""That's not very complimentary, either."""
"Scottie said: ""No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!""
Judy said: ""Why?!""
Scottie said: ""Please! And don't look at me."""
"Scottie said: ""Will you, Judy?""
Judy said: ""I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick."""
"Judy said: ""I like that one.""
Scottie said: ""No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?""
Judy said: ""Yes --"""
"Scottie said: ""Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.""
Judy said: ""Honest?"""
"Scottie said: ""There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.""
Judy said: ""But Scottie, you don't have to!""
Scottie said: ""I want to! Come on!"""
"Judy said: ""But I like that one, Scottie.""
Scottie said: ""No, it's not right."""
"Judy said: ""Scottie, what are you doing?""
Scottie said: ""I'm trying to buy you a suit.""
Judy said: ""But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.""
Scottie said: ""They're none of them right.""
Judy said: ""But why?"""
"Judy said: ""You want me to dress like her?""
Scottie said: ""Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.""
Judy said: ""Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!""
Scottie said: ""Judy --""
Judy said: ""It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?"""
"Scottie said: ""Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --""
Judy said: ""No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!""
Scottie said: ""Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!"""
"Judy said: ""I don't like it!""
Scottie said: ""We'll take it! Will it fit?"""
"Judy said: ""I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.""
Scottie said: ""You can.""
Judy said: ""No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go..."""
"Scottie said: ""Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.""
Judy said: ""I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.""
Scottie said: ""No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you."""
"Judy said: ""You don't even want to touch me.""
Scottie said: ""Yes. Yes, I do."""
"Scottie said: ""The color of your hair...""
Judy said: ""Ah, no!""
Scottie said: ""Judy, please it can't matter to you..."""
"Judy said: ""The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?""
Scottie said: ""Yes.""
Judy said: ""All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me."""
"Judy said: ""Well?""
Scottie said: ""It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.""
Judy said: ""We tried it. It didn't suit me."""
"Judy said: ""Where shall we go for dinner?""
Scottie said: ""Wherever you'd like...""
Judy said: ""Ernie's?""
Scottie said: ""You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?""
Judy said: ""Well, after all, it's ""our place."""""
"Scottie said: ""Mmmm.""
Judy said: ""Is that the best you can do?"""
"Scottie said: ""Come here.""
Judy said: ""Oh, no. You'll muss me.""
Scottie said: ""That's what I had in mind.""
Judy said: ""Too late. I've got my face on."""
"Judy said: ""I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?""
Scottie said: ""No, Ernie's is fine.""
Judy said: ""I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start..."""
"Scottie said: ""I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.""
Judy said: ""Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!""
Scottie said: ""All in good time."""
"Judy said: ""Scottie!""
Scottie said: ""How does it work?""
Judy said: ""Can't you see?""
Scottie said: ""Oh, yeah. There."""
"Judy said: ""We're going awfully far.""
Scottie said: ""I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?""
Judy said: ""No, it's all right."""
"Judy said: ""Where are you going?""
Scottie said: ""To complete my cure."""
"Judy said: ""Scottie, why are we here?""
Scottie said: ""I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.""
Judy said: ""But why? Why here?""
Scottie said: ""Madeleine died here."""
"Judy said: ""No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.""
Scottie said: ""I need you.""
Judy said: ""Why?""
Scottie said: ""I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free."""
"Judy said: ""I'm scared.""
Scottie said: ""So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now."""
"Scottie said: ""...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, ""If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --""
Judy said: ""Scottie --""
Scottie said: ""-- and wanted to go on loving you."" And I said, ""I won't lose you.""  But I did."""
"Scottie said: ""And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.""
Judy said: ""Take me away...""
Scottie said: ""You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.""
Judy said: ""No!""
Scottie said: ""Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow."""
"Scottie said: ""We're going up the tower, Madeleine.""
Judy said: ""No! Let me go!""
Scottie said: ""We're going up the tower.""
Judy said: ""You can't. You're afraid!""
Scottie said: ""I'm going to. It's my second chance."""
"Judy said: ""Scottie, please...!""
Scottie said: ""But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?""
Judy said: ""Yes!""
Scottie said: ""And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?""
Judy said: ""Dead. He'd broken her neck.""
Scottie said: ""Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?""
Judy said: ""I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --""
Scottie said: ""Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!"""
"Scottie said: ""Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?""
Judy said: ""Yes!""
Scottie said: ""And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!""
Judy said: ""Your accident...""
Scottie said: ""Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?""
Judy said: ""I don't know... Switzerland?""
Scottie said: ""We'll find him."""
"Scottie said: ""I made it.""
Judy said: ""What are you going to do?""
Scottie said: ""Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in."""
"Scottie said: ""Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?""
Judy said: ""Some money.""
Scottie said: ""And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental."""
"Judy said: ""What are you going to do?""
Scottie said: ""I loved you, Madeleine.""
Judy said: ""I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!"""
"Judy said: ""Love me... keep me safe...""
Scottie said: ""Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back."""
"Madeleine said: ""Why am I here? What happened?""
Scottie said: ""You...  ...fell into the Bay."""
"Scottie said: ""You don't remember.""
Madeleine said: ""No...""
Scottie said: ""Do you remember where you were?""
Madeleine said: ""Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!""
Scottie said: ""Where were you?""
Madeleine said: ""At..."""
"Madeleine said: ""...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!""
Scottie said: ""Why?""
Madeleine said: ""Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.""
Scottie said: ""Where had you been before?""
Madeleine said: ""When?""
Scottie said: ""This afternoon.""
Madeleine said: ""Oh... wandering about.""
Scottie said: ""Before?  Where?  Where had you been?"""
"Scottie said: ""Please drink your coffee.""
Madeleine said: ""I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.""
Scottie said: ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.""
Madeleine said: ""You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?""
Scottie said: ""Wandering about.""
Madeleine said: ""You like it, too."""
"Scottie said: ""The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.""
Madeleine said: ""Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past."""
"Madeleine said: ""Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.""
Scottie said: ""No."""
"Madeleine said: ""When you...  There were pins in my hair...""
Scottie said: ""Oh! Yes! Here!"""
"Madeleine said: ""You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.""
Scottie said: ""I... didn't know where you lived.""
Madeleine said: ""You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?""
Scottie said: ""Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.""
Madeleine said: ""No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.""
Scottie said: ""My name is John Ferguson.""
Madeleine said: ""That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.""
Scottie said: ""John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.""
Madeleine said: ""I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.""
Scottie said: ""No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.""
Madeleine said: ""I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?""
Scottie said: ""Wander about.""
Madeleine said: ""That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?"""
"Madeleine said: ""One shouldn't live alone.""
Scottie said: ""Some people prefer it.""
Madeleine said: ""No... it's wrong."""
"Scottie said: ""Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?""
Madeleine said: ""What?""
Scottie said: ""...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?"""
"Madeleine said: ""No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?""
Scottie said: ""No... this is the first time for me, too."""
"Madeleine said: ""Oh! Yes. Hello.""
Scottie said: ""Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.""
Madeleine said: ""I... suddenly felt such a fool.""
Scottie said: ""I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?""
Madeleine said: ""Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.""
Scottie said: ""You've nothing to apologize for.""
Madeleine said: ""Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!""
Scottie said: ""Not at all, I enjoyed --"""
"Scottie said: ""-- talking to you...""
Madeleine said: ""I enjoyed talking to you."""
"Scottie said: ""Would you like some coffee?""
Madeleine said: ""No! No, thank you!"""
"Madeleine said: ""I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.""
Scottie said: ""The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower."""
"Scottie said: ""I hope we will, too.""
Madeleine said: ""What?""
Scottie said: ""Meet again, sometime.""
Madeleine said: ""We have."""
"Madeleine said: ""Good-bye.""
Scottie said: ""Good-bye."""
"Madeleine said: ""I don't know.""
Scottie said: ""Shopping?""
Madeleine said: ""No.""
Scottie said: ""Well... anywhere in particular?""
Madeleine said: ""No, I Just thought I'd wander.""
Scottie said: ""Ah.  That's what I was going to do.""
Madeleine said: ""Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?"""
"Scottie said: ""Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...""
Madeleine said: ""Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.""
Scottie said: ""No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true."""
"Scottie said: ""Do you know where you're going?""
Madeleine said: ""Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!""
Scottie said: ""How can you be sure?""
Madeleine said: ""If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't."""
"Madeleine said: ""How old?""
Scottie said: ""Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.""
Madeleine said: ""The oldest living things?"""
"Scottie said: ""What are you thinking?""
Madeleine said: ""Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.""
Scottie said: ""Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.""
Madeleine said: ""I don't like them.""
Scottie said: ""Why?""
Madeleine said: ""Knowing I have to die..."""
"Madeleine said: ""Do you hear anything?""
Scottie said: ""Only silence. It's always like this.""
Madeleine said: ""And no birds sing.""
Scottie said: ""No birds live here.""
Madeleine said: ""No."""
"Scottie said: ""Would you like a drink of water?""
Madeleine said: ""No, thank you."""
"Madeleine said: ""Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...""
Scottie said: ""Madeleine!"""
"Scottie said: ""Where are you now?""
Madeleine said: ""Here with you.""
Scottie said: ""Where?""
Madeleine said: ""The tall trees...""
Scottie said: ""Have you been here before?""
Madeleine said: ""Yes...""
Scottie said: ""When?"""
"Scottie said: ""Where were you born?""
Madeleine said: ""Long ago...""
Scottie said: ""Where?"""
"Madeleine said: ""No!... No!""
Scottie said: ""Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?""
Madeleine said: ""No, don't ask me!"""
"Scottie said: ""When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.""
Madeleine said: ""I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!""
Scottie said: ""Why did you jump?""
Madeleine said: ""No!""
Scottie said: ""What was it inside that told you to jump?"""
"Madeleine said: ""No, I can't tell you!""
Scottie said: ""What?!""
Madeleine said: ""No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!"""
"Madeleine said: ""Take me away from here?""
Scottie said: ""Home?""
Madeleine said: ""...somewhere in the light."""
"Scottie said: ""I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.""
Madeleine said: ""And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?"""
"Madeleine said: ""There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.""
Scottie said: ""Yesterday."""
"Scottie said: ""But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.""
Madeleine said: ""Vaguely...""
Scottie said: ""What do you remember?""
Madeleine said: ""A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...""
Scottie said: ""Would you know the room?""
Madeleine said: ""No... it's in shadow.""
Scottie said: ""What else?""
Madeleine said: ""A grave...""
Scottie said: ""Where?""
Madeleine said: ""I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.""
Scottie said: ""How do you know?""
Madeleine said: ""I know.""
Scottie said: ""There's a name on the gravestone.""
Madeleine said: ""No. It's new and clean, and waiting.""
Scottie said: ""What else?""
Madeleine said: ""This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.""
Scottie said: ""A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?""
Madeleine said: ""No.""
Scottie said: ""Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?""
Madeleine said: ""But I'm the woman in the mirror!""
Scottie said: ""No!"""
"Scottie said: ""If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...""
Madeleine said: ""And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?"""
"Madeleine said: ""I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!""
Scottie said: ""I'm here, I've got you...""
Madeleine said: ""I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen..."""
"Madeleine said: ""Don't leave me... stay with me...""
Scottie said: ""All the time."""
"Madeleine said: ""I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...""
Scottie said: ""Why? What's happened?""
Madeleine said: ""I had the dream. The dream came back again..."""
"Madeleine said: ""No, don't go away!""
Scottie said: ""Only this far."""
"Scottie said: ""Where's your husband?""
Madeleine said: ""I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know..."""
"Scottie said: ""It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?""
Madeleine said: ""It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...""
Scottie said: ""Yes --""
Madeleine said: ""But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...""
Scottie said: ""Tell me.""
Madeleine said: ""There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside."""
"Scottie said: ""Go on.""
Madeleine said: ""At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --""
Scottie said: ""-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.""
Madeleine said: ""Yes?! But --""

"Scottie said: ""You've been there before. You've seen it.""
Madeleine said: ""No, never!""
Scottie said: ""Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!""
Madeleine said: ""No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!"""
"Scottie said: ""Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?""
Madeleine said: ""I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up..."""
"Madeleine said: ""Here with you.""
Scottie said: ""And it's a all real.""
Madeleine said: ""Yes.""
Scottie said: ""Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!"""
"Scottie said: ""My love... because I love you.""
Madeleine said: ""I love you too... too late... too late...""
Scottie said: ""No... we're together...""
Madeleine said: ""Too late... there's something I must do..."""
"Scottie said: ""There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.""
Madeleine said: ""You can't.""
Scottie said: ""Why?""
Madeleine said: ""Let me go.""
Scottie said: ""Where?""
Madeleine said: ""To the church, I must go there.""
Scottie said: ""Madeleine --""
Madeleine said: ""Please let me go."""
"Madeleine said: ""It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!""
Scottie said: ""It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --""
Madeleine said: ""Let me go! Let me go!!""
Scottie said: ""Madeleine!!"""
"Madeleine said: ""You believe that I love you?""
Scottie said: ""Yes.""
Madeleine said: ""And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.""
Scottie said: ""I won't lose you."""
"Madeleine said: ""Let me go into the church alone.""
Scottie said: ""Why?""
Madeleine said: ""Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run."""
"Manageress said: ""Is there something I can do for you?""
Scottie said: ""Yes... you run this hotel.""
Manageress said: ""Oh, yes!""
Scottie said: ""Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?""
Manageress said: ""Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --"""
"Manageress said: ""Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?""
Scottie said: ""Please answer my question.""
Manageress said: ""I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --""
Scottie said: ""What is her name?""
Manageress said: ""Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.""
Scottie said: ""Carlotta Valdes?""
Manageress said: ""Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.""
Scottie said: ""How long has she had the room?""
Manageress said: ""Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.""
Scottie said: ""Does she sleep here? Ever?""
Manageress said: ""No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --""
Scottie said: ""When she comes down, don't say that I've been here."""
"Manageress said: ""Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.""
Scottie said: ""I saw her come in five minutes. ago.""
Manageress said: ""Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!"""
"Manageress said: ""And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!""
Scottie said: ""Would you please go and look?""
Manageress said: ""In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly..."""

Midge said: ""I thought you said no more aches and pains?""
Scottie said: ""It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.""
Midge said: ""No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.""
Scottie said: ""Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!""
Midge said: ""What's tomorrow?""
Scottie said: ""Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined."""
"Scottie said: ""Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?""
Midge said: ""More than you think.""
Scottie said: ""How do you know? Personal experience?""
Midge said: ""Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?""
Scottie said: ""What do you mean?""
Midge said: ""What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?""
Scottie said: ""You sound so disapproving, Midge.""
Midge said: ""No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.""
Scottie said: ""I had to quit, Midge.""
Midge said: ""Why?""
Scottie said: ""I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.""
Midge said: ""It wasn't your fault.""
Scottie said: ""I know. Everybody tells me.""
Midge said: ""Johnny, the doctors explained --""
Scottie said: ""I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.""
Midge said: ""Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?""
Scottie said: ""And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?""
Midge said: ""It's where you belong.""
Scottie said: ""Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!""
Midge said: ""Ah, Johnny-O..."""
"Midge said: ""Well?... what'll you do?""
Scottie said: ""Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.""
Midge said: ""Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?""
Scottie said: ""To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.""
Midge said: ""Have you had any dizzy spells this week?""
Scottie said: ""I'm having one now."""
"Scottie said: ""From that music.""
Midge said: ""Oh!"""
"Midge said: ""It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.""
Scottie said: ""I've never run across one like that.""
Midge said: ""It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.""
Scottie said: ""Uh-huh!""
Midge said: ""An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.""
Scottie said: ""What a pleasant hobby."""
"Scottie said: ""How's your love life, Midge?""
Midge said: ""That's following a train of thought.""
Scottie said: ""Well?""
Midge said: ""Normal.""
Scottie said: ""Aren't you ever going to get married?""
Midge said: ""You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.""
Scottie said: ""Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?""
Midge said: ""Three whole weeks.""
Scottie said: ""Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?""
Midge said: ""Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.""
Scottie said: ""I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.""
Midge said: ""That's Skid Row... isn't it?""
Scottie said: ""Could be.""
Midge said: ""He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.""
Scottie said: ""Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.""
Midge said: ""Sorry, old man. Work.""
Scottie said: ""Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?""
Midge said: ""What.""
Scottie said: ""My... the acrophobia.""
Midge said: ""I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.""
Scottie said: ""I think I can lick it.""
Midge said: ""How?""
Scottie said: ""I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?"""
"Scottie said: ""Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.""
Midge said: ""That!?!""
Scottie said: ""What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?"""
"Scottie said: ""Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.""
Midge said: ""Stop kidding. Wait a minute."""
"Midge said: ""Step number two.""
Scottie said: ""Okay."""
"Midge said: ""Easy, now.""
Scottie said: ""This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --"""
"Midge said: ""Johnny!""
Scottie said: ""Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --"""
"Midge said: ""Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this ""hello you look wonderful"" stuff. Just a good straight ""who do you know"" --""
Scottie said: ""Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.""
Midge said: ""Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.""
Scottie said: ""Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!""
Midge said: ""Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?""
Scottie said: ""Yeah.""
Midge said: ""Pop Leibel.""
Scottie said: ""Who?""
Midge said: ""Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?""
Scottie said: ""Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879."""
"Midge said: ""Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?""
Scottie said: ""Do you know him well?""
Midge said: ""Pop Leibel? Sure.""
Scottie said: ""All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?"""
"Midge said: ""The poor thing....""
Scottie said: ""And she died..."""
"Midge said: ""Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.""
Scottie said: ""For what?""
Midge said: ""For bringing you here. Come on, tell!""
Scottie said: ""Nothing to tell.""
Midge said: ""You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!""
Scottie said: ""I'll take you home."""
"Scottie said: ""Here you are.""
Midge said: ""You haven't told me everything.""
Scottie said: ""I've told you enough.""
Midge said: ""Who's the guy, who's the wife?""
Scottie said: ""Out. I've got things to do.""
Midge said: ""I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.""
Scottie said: ""Out!""
Midge said: ""And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!""
Scottie said: ""I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!""
Midge said: ""Think?  Well, what do you think?"""
"Midge said: ""Is she pretty?""
Scottie said: ""Carlotta?""
Midge said: ""No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.""
Scottie said: ""Mmm, yeah, I guess..."""
"Scottie said: ""Midge!""
Midge said: ""Bye-bye!"""
"Scottie said: ""I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?""
Midge said: ""Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?""
Scottie said: ""Just wander.""
Midge said: ""Where?""
Scottie said: ""Around.""
Midge said: ""Oh?"""
"Scottie said: ""Mm. Better.""
Midge said: ""Did you need it?""
Scottie said: ""Yeah.""
Midge said: ""Oh?"""
"Scottie said: ""What was this desperate urge to see me?""
Midge said: ""All I said in the note was: ""Where are you?"" That doesn't sound desperate to me.""
Scottie said: ""Well, I detected an undercurrent.""
Midge said: ""I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.""
Scottie said: ""Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?""
Midge said: ""Oh... this and that.""
Scottie said: ""What I've been doing?""
Midge said: ""If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.""
Scottie said: ""Naturally."""
"Midge said: ""What have you been doing?""
Scottie said: ""Wandering."""
"Midge said: ""Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.""
Scottie said: ""Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.""
Midge said: ""Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.""
Scottie said: ""What is it, a still life?""
Midge said: ""No, not exactly. Want to see?"""
"Midge said: ""As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.""
Scottie said: ""Oh?"""
"Pop Leibel said: ""Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...""
Scottie said: ""What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?""
Pop Leibel said: ""It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.""
Scottie said: ""By whom?""
Pop Leibel said: ""By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child."""
"Pop Leibel said: ""She died.""
Scottie said: ""How?""
Pop Leibel said: ""By her own hand.  There are many such stories.""
Scottie said: ""Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much."""

Saleswoman said: ""But you said grey, sir.""
Scottie said: ""Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted."""

"Scottie said: ""Yes! That's it!""
Saleswoman said: ""I thought so!"""
"Saleswoman said: ""Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.""
Scottie said: ""How soon can it be altered?""
Saleswoman said: ""Well...""
Scottie said: ""Can we have it by tonight?""
Saleswoman said: ""Well, if it's absolutely necessary...""
Scottie said: ""Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out."""

Adam said: ""I got children. I've got a life."""
"Boyd said: ""All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?""
Adam said: ""No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all."""

Adam said: ""They're driving me nuts!""
Lois said: ""They're singing."""
"Lois said: ""Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.""
Adam said: ""What?""
Lois said: ""They're screaming for Starbursts.""
Adam said: ""Later.""
Lois said: ""They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts."""
"Lois said: ""Where's the candy?""
Adam said: ""There is no candy!""
Lois said: ""What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!"""
"Fisher said: ""We'll be ready Adam.""
Adam said: ""I know you'll be.  Three hours."""
"Adam said: ""That's one idea.""
Fisher said: ""No...we want padded chairs...okay?"""
"Fisher said: ""Real times.""
Adam said: ""They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin..."""
"Adam said: ""No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.""
Fisher said: ""Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.""
Adam said: ""Are you solid with that?""
Fisher said: ""No. I think it's fucked.""
Adam said: ""Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?"""
"Fisher said: ""The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.""
Adam said: ""Don't ever stare him down.""
Fisher said: ""I won't do it.""
Adam said: ""Don't eyeball your kids."""
"Adam said: ""I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...""
Fisher said: ""I know and I'm honored...""
Adam said: ""If anything ever happens to me...""
Fisher said: ""I know...""
Adam said: ""Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little..."""
"Adam said: ""Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.""
Fisher said: ""What happened? Oh my God..."""
"Fisher said: ""No way.""
Adam said: ""It has to be done."""
"Adam said: ""I want you to hear me out.""
Fisher said: ""What.""
Adam said: ""You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.""
Fisher said: ""I don't think so.""
Adam said: ""We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves."""
"Adam said: ""Have you thought about what I said?""
Fisher said: ""Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?""
Adam said: ""I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...""
Fisher said: ""I got you.""
Adam said: ""Where's the bathroom?"""
"Liz said: ""My god.""
Barry Morris said: ""There's more."""
"Liz said: ""Money?""
Barry Morris said: ""Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.""
Liz said: ""What does that mean?"""
"Barry Morris said: ""Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.""
Liz said: ""Well, oh...""
Barry Morris said: ""And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.""
Liz said: ""So where's that leave us?"""
"Barry Morris said: ""So. When is the wedding.""
Liz said: ""Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow."""
"Boyd said: ""What are you talking about?""
Lois said: ""Don't sweet lip me.""
Boyd said: ""I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...""
Lois said: ""You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.""
Boyd said: ""Nothing happened in Vegas.""
Lois said: ""I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?"""
"Lois said: ""Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?""
Boyd said: ""Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...""
Lois said: ""Shut up Boyd! Micheal?"""
"Boyd said: ""He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.""
Lois said: ""I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.""
Boyd said: ""Lois please."""
"Boyd said: ""What is it?""
Ralph said: ""Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?"""
"Boyd said: ""What?""
Ralph said: ""I'm with Tina. Is she there?"""
"Boyd said: ""She's not here.""
Ralph said: ""Where is she?""
Boyd said: ""She's here. She's just...Hold on a second."""
"Ralph said: ""Okay. Hi.""
Ralph said: ""So who's the lucky guy?""
Boyd said: ""Who?""
Ralph said: ""The groom?"""
"Boyd said: ""Yup.""
Ralph said: ""Doing the bachelor party thing?""
Boyd said: ""That's right.""
Ralph said: ""Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?""
Boyd said: ""She's in the bathroom...she's still working.""
Ralph said: ""She's still working?""
Boyd said: ""That's right.""
Ralph said: ""Sweet deal."""
"Ralph said: ""Is everything okay?""
Boyd said: ""Great. Fine. Perfect."""
"Boyd said: ""She's in there!""
Ralph said: ""I'm just gonna let her know I'm here."""
"Moore said: ""No I don't.""
Boyd said: ""Fish?"""
"Moore said: ""Your investment ideas never work out.""
Boyd said: ""That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big."""
"Moore said: ""I don't think so Boyd.""
Boyd said: ""Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir."""
"Boyd said: ""But not tonight.""
Moore said: ""Not tonight."""
"Moore said: ""Keith Richards, Dean Martin...""
Boyd said: ""Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard..."""
"Boyd said: ""Where do you look? What side of the neck?""
Moore said: ""Left side."""
"Moore said: ""He's right.""
Boyd said: ""We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground."""
"Boyd said: ""I got her arm.""
Moore said: ""Here's his head."""
"Boyd said: ""The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.""
Moore said: ""Today is the best day of the rest of our lives."""
"Moore said: ""What's your fucking point?""
Boyd said: ""I'm not talking to you?"""
"Moore said: ""What's goosed?""
Boyd said: ""What is her disposition?"""
"Moore said: ""He just had two.""
Boyd said: ""Give me two more."""
"Moore said: ""He's too drunk.""
Boyd said: ""He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here."""
"Fisher said: ""You said that Boyd.""
Boyd said: ""Well, I didn't mean it."""
"Fisher said: ""Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.""
Boyd said: ""Who's up for making some real money?"""
"Fisher said: ""Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...""
Boyd said: ""Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir."""
"Fisher said: ""No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.""
Boyd said: ""That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.""
Fisher said: ""We need padded chairs.""
Boyd said: ""Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English..."""
"Boyd said: ""She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.""
Fisher said: ""I can't."""
"Fisher said: ""Oh, Jesus...call the police.""
Boyd said: ""No.""
Fisher said: ""She's dead. Call somebody!""
Boyd said: ""Shut up.""
Fisher said: ""Call 911.""
Boyd said: ""Shut up."""
"Fisher said: ""Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!""
Boyd said: ""Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose..."""
"Fisher said: ""Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.""
Boyd said: ""Nobody knows."""
"Fisher said: ""Oh God. This is insane.""
Boyd said: ""What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane."""
"Boyd said: ""Nobody knows she's here.""
Fisher said: ""Good God...Good God..."""
"Boyd said: ""All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.""
Fisher said: ""I'm calling the police.""
Boyd said: ""So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?"""
"Boyd said: ""That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.""
Fisher said: ""I think we should say some words over the grave.""
Boyd said: ""What kind of words?""
Fisher said: ""I'm talking about prayer.""
Boyd said: ""Go ahead."""
"Fisher said: ""Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.""
Boyd said: ""No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker."""
"Fisher said: ""It goes; ""Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.""""
Boyd said: ""However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?"""
"Boyd said: ""Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.""
Fisher said: ""You always were a jealous man."""
"Boyd said: ""The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...""
Fisher said: ""No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking..."""
"Boyd said: ""OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.""
Fisher said: ""Shut up Boyd.""
Boyd said: ""Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.""
Fisher said: ""He's having a problem here."""
"Fisher said: ""Easy Boyd.""
Boyd said: ""No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?"""
"Fisher said: ""He's cracked up.""
Boyd said: ""He is not cracking up.""
Fisher said: ""Boyd...What have we done?""
Boyd said: ""What did you ask me?""
Fisher said: ""What?""
Boyd said: ""What is the question you asked me?""
Fisher said: ""I said, what have we done?""
Boyd said: ""Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?""
Fisher said: ""I don't know! I just want to get married.""
Boyd said: ""Say it again.""
Fisher said: ""What?""
Boyd said: ""What you just said. Say it again.""
Fisher said: ""I just want to get married.""
Boyd said: ""Exactly! Exactly my point."""
"Fisher said: ""What's your point?""
Boyd said: ""You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes."""
"Fisher said: ""Regarding what?""
Boyd said: ""Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?""
Fisher said: ""No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right."""
"Fisher said: ""Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.""
Boyd said: ""Suck my ass."""
"Boyd said: ""After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.""
Fisher said: ""I don't think that's such a good idea.""
Boyd said: ""Just do it.""
Fisher said: ""What are you going to do?""
Boyd said: ""Take care of business.""
Fisher said: ""What does that mean?""
Boyd said: ""And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?""
Fisher said: ""I don't know...""
Boyd said: ""You got a nasty side to your thought process."""
"Boyd said: ""Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.""
Fisher said: ""What does that mean?"""
"Boyd said: ""I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?""
Fisher said: ""Yeah.""
Boyd said: ""Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.""
Fisher said: ""Hear what?""
Boyd said: ""That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.""
Fisher said: ""Now?"""
"Boyd said: ""That's right.""
Fisher said: ""Isn't it a little late?""
Boyd said: ""Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?"""
"Boyd said: ""This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.""
Fisher said: ""I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.""
Boyd said: ""My what?""
Fisher said: ""You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.""
Boyd said: ""You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?""
Fisher said: ""I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!""
Boyd said: ""Okay fine.""
Fisher said: ""Fine? Fine what?""
Boyd said: ""Whatever you say Kojak.""
Fisher said: ""I'm serious.""
Boyd said: ""I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money."""
"Boyd said: ""Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.""
Fisher said: ""You're sick.""
Boyd said: ""And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!""
Fisher said: ""Not a prayer.""
Boyd said: ""I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!""
Fisher said: ""You need help."""
"Boyd said: ""You're a fucking moron.""
Micheal said: ""It's my fucking opinion."""

Micheal said: ""The hell you didn't!""
Boyd said: ""The hell I did!""
Micheal said: ""You said one in two marriages end in divorce.""

Micheal said: ""You hate women.""

Micheal said: ""True.""
Boyd said: ""Not true.""
Micheal said: ""You have a King fantasy.""
Boyd said: ""I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.""
Micheal said: ""And what happens when you can't?""
Boyd said: ""New king."""
"Boyd said: ""If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?""
Micheal said: ""Israel doesn't have a King.""
Boyd said: ""Then what do they have?""
Micheal said: ""They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.""
Boyd said: ""I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.""
Micheal said: ""What's your point?""
Boyd said: ""Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?""
Micheal said: ""The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.""
Boyd said: ""There's my point exactly.""
Micheal said: ""What? What's your point?""
Boyd said: ""Take Mexico.""
Micheal said: ""What?""
Boyd said: ""Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico."""
"Boyd said: ""The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.""
Micheal said: ""They need leadership.""
Boyd said: ""That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?"""
"Boyd said: ""A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?""
Micheal said: ""Not really, no.""
Boyd said: ""Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders."""
"Boyd said: ""Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.""
Micheal said: ""You said nobody would miss her.""
Boyd said: ""No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel."""
"Boyd said: ""This is going to stop right now. Right now!""
Micheal said: ""You will not screw this up."""
"Boyd said: ""The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?""
Micheal said: ""Ball park sausages.""
Boyd said: ""You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?""
Micheal said: ""Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for ""The Immaculate Reception,"" his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.""
Boyd said: ""Easy Micheal.""
Micheal said: ""He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out."""

Judge Tower said: ""All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?""
Fisher said: ""Are we supposed to?""
Judge Tower said: ""It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't."""

Liz said: ""I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.""
Fisher said: ""Don't we already have someone to do that for us?""
Liz said: ""Yeah. You.""
Fisher said: ""Okay. Okay."""
"Fisher said: ""That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.""
Liz said: ""No.""

Fisher said: ""She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...""

Fisher said: ""But...""
Liz said: ""No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.""
Fisher said: ""But...""
Liz said: ""No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!"""

Liz said: ""What does that mean?""
Fisher said: ""Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.""
Liz said: ""Like how?""
Fisher said: ""I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.""
Liz said: ""The only proof is those bodies.""
Fisher said: ""So what do we do?""
Liz said: ""Move the bodies.""
Fisher said: ""Move the bodies?"""

Fisher said: ""Buzzing?""
Micheal said: ""Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.""

Micheal said: ""Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.""
Fisher said: ""Have another drink."""

Fisher said: ""The wahoo?""
Micheal said: ""The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?""
Fisher said: ""The wahoo moment?""
Micheal said: ""That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?""
Fisher said: ""I think so.""
Micheal said: ""I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things."""
"Fisher said: ""I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.""
Micheal said: ""No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois."""

Moore said: ""Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim..."""

Fisher said: ""Downstairs in the closet."""
"Moore said: ""He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.""
Fisher said: ""My God...""
Moore said: ""He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading ""Atlas Shrugged,"" staring at himself in the mirror.""
Fisher said: ""Did he try to kiss you?""
Moore said: ""All week long."""
"Moore said: ""You alright?""
Fisher said: ""Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping ""Immaculate Reception?"" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?""
Moore said: ""I guess.""
Fisher said: ""I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce?

He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - ""Pup Corn.""""
Moore said: ""Pup corn?""
Fisher said: ""That's right, ""Pup Corn."" Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of ""Pup Corn"" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes ""Shelmer,"" our 8 year old mutt. ""Here Shelmer,"" my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, ""Here girl."" This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the ""Pup Corn."" Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, ""Pup Corn"" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never."""
"Fisher said: ""There.""
Moore said: ""Where?"""
"Fisher said: ""Yeah?""
Moore said: ""I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.""
Fisher said: ""That's a good one.""
Moore said: ""I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?"""
"Fisher said: ""I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.""
Moore said: ""That's what I'm thinking."""
"Moore said: ""Well that ought to be about the end of that.""
Fisher said: ""Yup."""

Judge Tower said: ""Okay great. What will that be?""
Liz said: ""We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.""
Judge Tower said: ""What song?""

Judge Tower said: ""Oh I know that. How does it go...""

Viridiana said: ""Wasn't that cowardice?""
Don Jaime said: ""No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed."""

Viridiana said: ""Go away! Leave me alone."""
"Viridiana said: ""Let me pass!""
Don Jaime said: ""You must listen to me before you go.""
Viridiana said: ""I've listened to you long enough. Let me out."""
"Don Jaime said: ""All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.""
Viridiana said: ""You disgust me... even if what you say is true.""
Don Jaime said: ""Then you won't forgive me?"""

Ramona said: ""Yes, sir. Good night."""
"Ramona said: ""Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?""
Don Jaime said: ""I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone."""

Ramona said: ""What's the matter?"""
"Don Jaime said: ""Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?""
Ramona said: ""I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.""
Don Jaime said: ""Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?""
Ramona said: ""Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything."""
"Don Jaime said: ""Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.""
Ramona said: ""But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?"""
"Don Jaime said: ""The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.""
Ramona said: ""Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.""
Don Jaime said: ""What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.""
Ramona said: ""But what can I say to her, sir?""
Don Jaime said: ""Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her."""
"Don Jaime said: ""You believe me, don't you?""
Ramona said: ""Yes, sir."""
"Don Jaime said: ""Don't lie. You don't believe me either.""
Ramona said: ""It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir."""
"Enedina said: ""What will the lady say?""
Poca said: ""She won't even know.""
Enedina said: ""If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours."""
"Poca said: ""Is it all right?""
Enedina said: ""Yes.""
Poca said: ""Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir."""
"Enedina said: ""They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...""
Poca said: ""I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ..."""
"Jorge said: ""How much is that?""
Foreman said: ""Fifteen yards.""
Jorge said: ""That's fifteen by seven?""
Foreman said: ""That's it.""
Jorge said: ""Good."""
"Foreman said: ""Have you thought of what you want planted yet?""
Jorge said: ""The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.""
Foreman said: ""It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.""
Jorge said: ""And in the vegetable plot?""
Foreman said: ""That's good land."""
"Jorge said: ""Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?""
Foreman said: ""No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?""
Jorge said: ""Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon."""
"Viridiana said: ""Me?""
Hobbly said: ""Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty."""
"Hobbly said: ""It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.""
Viridiana said: ""Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?"""
"Viridiana said: ""It's very good.""
Hobbly said: ""Thank you; but it's missing something.""
Viridiana said: ""That doesn't matter; I like it."""
"Viridiana said: ""My God, what have you done to him!""
Hobbly said: ""He was asking for it.""
Viridiana said: ""But why? Why?"""
"Viridiana said: ""Ramona! Ramona!""
Hobbly said: ""Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ..."""
"Lucia said: ""Not in that way; you're always looking for company.""
Jorge said: ""Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous."""
"Lucia said: ""What's the matter with you?""
Jorge said: ""Nothing.""
Lucia said: ""Why the bad temper?""
Jorge said: ""It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves."""
"Lucia said: ""She's mad.""
Jorge said: ""No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.""
Lucia said: ""Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ..."""
"Jorge said: ""So, Ramona!""
Lucia said: ""Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly."""
"Jorge said: ""If you wake first, wake me up.""
Lucia said: ""What are you going to do?"""
"Jorge said: ""What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.""
Lucia said: ""You're happy, aren't you!"""
"Jorge said: ""Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...""
Lucia said: ""I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.""
Jorge said: ""You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this."""
"Jorge said: ""What are you thinking about?""
Lucia said: ""That your cousin is more to your taste."""
"Jorge said: ""She isn't my cousin.""
Lucia said: ""It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her."""
"Jorge said: ""How in hell does it wind up?""
Lucia said: ""I think I'd better go tomorrow.""
Jorge said: ""Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?"""
"Lucia said: ""You see how much you like her?""
Jorge said: ""That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?"""
"Leper said: ""Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...""
Jorge said: ""If you free me, you'll be a rich man ..."""
"Leper said: ""Me, rich? Come on!""
Jorge said: ""There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it."""
"Jorge said: ""I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.""
Leper said: ""Where's the dough?""
Jorge said: ""Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!"""
"Jorge said: ""Kill him.""
Leper said: ""That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch."""
"Ramona said: ""He was very good. Better than some people would think.""
Jorge said: ""Why did he kill himself?"""
"Ramona said: ""I don't know, sir.""
Jorge said: ""One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?"""
"Jorge said: ""And this chest?""
Ramona said: ""There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old."""
"Ramona said: ""I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.""
Jorge said: ""Why?""
Ramona said: ""You wouldn't be here otherwise.""
Jorge said: ""These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable."""
"Ramona said: ""I don't know -- they've always been there.""
Jorge said: ""That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used."""
"Jorge said: ""Miss Viridiana ...""
Viridiana said: ""Are you Jorge?"""
"Jorge said: ""Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.""
Viridiana said: ""I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer."""
"Viridiana said: ""Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?""
Jorge said: ""It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?""
Viridiana said: ""Well... is it so urgent?""
Jorge said: ""If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you."""
"Viridiana said: ""I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...""
Jorge said: ""But you have a right to let us know what you think.""
Viridiana said: ""I'm not interested. Do what you think's best."""
"Jorge said: ""What do you know about me?""
Viridiana said: ""I know that you used to work with an architect.""
Jorge said: ""And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now."""
"Jorge said: ""I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.""
Viridiana said: ""I'm not like you, you have your wife."""
"Jorge said: ""What are you doing here? Get out.""
Viridiana said: ""Leave him alone.""
Jorge said: ""You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.""
Viridiana said: ""Do they worry you that much, then?""
Jorge said: ""They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you."""
"Jorge said: ""There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.""
Viridiana said: ""I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.""
Jorge said: ""Is that all you're going to devote your life to?""
Viridiana said: ""I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day."""
"Viridiana said: ""Are they going to work here too?""
Jorge said: ""Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you."""
"Jorge said: ""Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.""
Viridiana said: ""I'll be ready.""
Jorge said: ""Do you intend to stay here for some time?"""
"Viridiana said: ""Yes. Why?""
Jorge said: ""You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere."""
"Viridiana said: ""And ...your friend?""
Jorge said: ""She's left.""
Viridiana said: ""Is she coming back?""
Jorge said: ""No.""
Viridiana said: ""Why?"""
"Peasant said: ""It's for people!""
Jorge said: ""Then let him go and he'll follow you.""
Peasant said: ""And let him get run over by somebody else?"""
"Peasant said: ""He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.""
Jorge said: ""How much do you want for him?""
Peasant said: ""I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you."""
"Peasant said: ""And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.""
Jorge said: ""What's he called?""
Peasant said: ""Canelo!"""
"Leper said: ""They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.""
Viridiana said: ""Are you sure it isn't contagious?""
Leper said: ""They told me it isn't at the hospital."""
"Leper said: ""They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.""
Viridiana said: ""I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!"""
"Viridiana said: ""How are you today?""
Leper said: ""Things seem to be getting better.""
Viridiana said: ""Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through."""
"Viridiana said: ""Are your parents alive?""
Leper said: ""Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!""
Viridiana said: ""Don't say that.""
Leper said: ""Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use."""
"Leper said: ""You'll soon find out, you liar!""
Viridiana said: ""Stop this!""
Leper said: ""He's lying through his ass!"""
"Mayor said: ""How do you do, Miss Viridiana!""
Viridiana said: ""Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?""
Mayor said: ""You cannot leave ...""
Viridiana said: ""Why not?""
Mayor said: ""There's been an accident.""
Viridiana said: ""Where?""
Mayor said: ""Come with me."""
"Moncho said: ""Why are you crying?""
Rita said: ""I'm afraid.""
Moncho said: ""Don't invent stories; go to bed.""
Rita said: ""A black bull came.""
Moncho said: ""A black bull!"""
"Rita said: ""It's a very big one.""
Moncho said: ""Very, very?""
Rita said: ""Yes -- very, very big!""
Moncho said: ""He couldn't get through the door, then?"""

Moncho said: ""You little liar! Get out of here!"""

Moncho said: ""They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready."""

Moncho said: ""But, miss ..."""

Moncho said: ""Yes!""
Viridiana said: ""I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?"""
"Viridiana said: ""Mother?""
Mother Superior said: ""I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.""
Viridiana said: ""All right, Mother."""
"Viridiana said: ""I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.""
Mother Superior said: ""In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.""
Viridiana said: ""I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.""
Mother Superior said: ""I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again."""
"Viridiana said: ""But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.""
Mother Superior said: ""He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?"""
"Viridiana said: ""I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...""
Mother Superior said: ""The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning."""
"Mother Superior said: ""Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?""
Viridiana said: ""Mother."""
"Mother Superior said: ""Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.""
Viridiana said: ""I had so many things to think about!""
Mother Superior said: ""A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me."""
"Mother Superior said: ""Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.""
Viridiana said: ""I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.""
Mother Superior said: ""Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?"""
"Viridiana said: ""Forgive me if I have offended you.""
Mother Superior said: ""You are forgiven. Goodbye."""
"Viridiana said: ""Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?""
Pelon said: ""When you are, miss.""
Viridiana said: ""Good, then let's go!"""
"Viridiana said: ""Don't talk like that!""
Pelon said: ""I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this."""
"Viridiana said: ""Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?""
Pelon said: ""I've had a gutful of this.""
Viridiana said: ""If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody."""
"Poca said: ""She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.""
Viridiana said: ""Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them."""
"Viridiana said: ""What about you, Manuel?""
Poca said: ""I'm only good at making people laugh.""
Viridiana said: ""That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that."""
"Poca said: ""She looks like a sick marrow!""
Viridiana said: ""Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good."""
"Poca said: ""Ask the priest, miss.""
Viridiana said: ""That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper."""

Viridiana said: ""I have a headache.""
Ramona said: ""That will soon pass. It's nothing."""

Ramona said: ""You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.""
Viridiana said: ""Have I slept long?""
Ramona said: ""Oh, you slept well; don't worry."""
"Rita said: ""Hello.""
Viridiana said: ""Hello."""
"Viridiana said: ""Good morning, Rita. How are we today?""
Rita said: ""Today, a good girl.""
Viridiana said: ""Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?"""
"Viridiana said: ""What?""
Rita said: ""Yes, yes, I saw you!"""
"Viridiana said: ""How did you see me?""
Rita said: ""From the terrace.""

Rita said: ""No, I don't want to."""

Parker said: ""Can you tell us what's on the disc?""
Alexiev said: "") There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it."""
"Parker said: ""In English, please.""
Alexiev said: ""I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program."""
"Alexiev said: ""It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.""
Parker said: ""It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.""
Alexiev said: ""Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful."""
"Parker said: ""You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.""
Alexiev said: ""Me? What did I do?"""
"Parker said: ""I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.""
Alexiev said: ""I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.""
Parker said: ""Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer."""
"Cox said: ""My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.""
Deane said: ""Why wasn't I told?"""
"Cox said: ""We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.""
Deane said: ""You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.""
Cox said: ""Whatever."""
"Cox said: ""Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?""
Deane said: ""Catch him and your record's clean."""
"Deane said: ""This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.""
Cox said: ""If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.""
Deane said: ""Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?"""
"Cox said: ""There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.""
Deane said: ""But only you will know he's not human."""
"Deane said: ""What are they doing in Los Feliz?""
Cox said: ""Madison lives two blocks from their present location.""
Deane said: ""Why would they be going there?""
Cox said: ""I don't know.""
Deane said: ""I wish we could hear them."""
"Cox said: ""Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.""
Deane said: ""He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?""
Cox said: ""Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.""
Deane said: ""You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?"""
"Cox said: ""You all right?""
Parker said: ""Why'd.. .you pull me out?""
Cox said: ""Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,"""
"Cox said: ""What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?""
Parker said: ""He was a computer program for crissake.""
Cox said: ""You were supposed to act as if everything was real.""
Parker said: ""Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?""
Cox said: ""Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?""
Parker said: ""I'm getting by."""
"Parker said: ""But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.""
Cox said: ""Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.""
Parker said: ""You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?""
Cox said: ""What about them?""
Parker said: ""Do me a favor  keep sending them."""
"Parker said: ""You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.""

Cox said: ""If you can catch him."""

Parker said: ""What she's going to do is get in my way."""
"Cox said: ""This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.""
Parker said: ""She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.""
Cox said: ""Fine  you want to stay here?"""
"Cox said: ""Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.""

Parker said: ""You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?"""

Parker said: ""Then I guess we're even."""
"Parker said: ""When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?""
Cox said: ""On my life, I promise you I will.""
Parker said: ""If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself."""

Madison said: ""Any sign of Lindenmeyer?""
Cox said: ""None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?""
Madison said: ""Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.""
Cox said: ""In other words, we collectively don't know shit."""
"Madison said: ""I should have told him.""
Cox said: ""Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?""
Madison said: ""I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.""
Cox said: ""You think he's smart?""
Madison said: ""Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming."""
"Madison said: ""There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.""
Cox said: ""I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?""
Madison said: ""I need your help--"""
"Cox said: ""Why didn't anybody tell me?!""
Madison said: ""I don't set policy.  You have the key?"""
"Cox said: ""Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.""
Madison said: ""Got it."""
"Madison said: ""Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?""
Deane said: ""We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.""
Madison said: ""What's the assignment?""
Deane said: ""You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field."""
"Deane said: ""That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?""
Madison said: ""Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.""
Deane said: ""Not if you're with him every step of the way.""
Madison said: ""The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.""
Deane said: ""I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you."""
"Deane said: ""I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.""
Parker said: ""Only because I got pulled out early.""
Deane said: ""Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do."""
"Deane said: ""Think you can do it?""
Parker said: ""Not from in here.""
Deane said: ""This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release."""
"Parker said: ""What happens if I can't catch him?""
Deane said: ""If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.""
Parker said: ""How do you know I won't run?"""
"Deane said: ""Barnes, where the hell have you been?!""
Parker said: ""Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?""
Deane said: ""What did you find out?""
Parker said: ""Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.""
Deane said: ""It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?""
Parker said: ""No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?""
Deane said: ""Enough to level an entire city block.""
Parker said: ""If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.""
Deane said: ""Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...""
Parker said: ""Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.""
Deane said: ""You know how much man power you're talking about?""
Parker said: ""You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to."""
"Deane said: ""This better not be a wild goose chase.""
Parker said: ""Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?""
Deane said: ""Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell."""
"Deane said: ""What did Cox pull him out early for?""
Wallace said: ""Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?""
Deane said: ""Don't remind me."""
"Deane said: ""What the hell happened?""
Wallace said: ""Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.""
Deane said: ""Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.""
Wallace said: ""I was assured the problem was corrected."""
"Wallace said: ""It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.""
Deane said: ""Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage."""
"Wallace said: ""You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.""
Wallace said: ""Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""I'm still making adjustments...""
Wallace said: ""You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""I'M WHAT?!""
Wallace said: ""You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""I understand... I understand perfectly."""
"Wallace said: ""How does he know who I am?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""He hears...everything.""
Wallace said: ""As a matter of fact, I do."""
"Reilly said: ""HEY!!!""
Lindenmeyer said: ""Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.""
Reilly said: ""I haven't been working on anything.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""Do I get to see it or not?""
Reilly said: ""Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back."""
"Lindenmeyer said: ""Get that fucking thing away from me!""
Reilly said: ""You're...such a wimp."""
"Reilly said: ""Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...""
Reilly said: ""Coordinated by polymer neural net.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""It feels so.. .real.""
Reilly said: ""It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""This is supposed to be years away.""
Reilly said: ""As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""How do you kill it?""
Reilly said: ""Separate the character module from the neural net..."""
"Reilly said: ""... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.""
Reilly said: ""I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you..."""
"Lindenmeyer said: ""You need a maid.""
Reilly said: ""What I need is a nymphomaniac."""
"Lindenmeyer said: ""I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.""
Madison said: ""What's wrong with Parker?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""How should I know?""
Madison said: ""Show me his physical sensory level."""
"Lindenmeyer said: ""I wonder how that...""
Madison said: ""Turn it down!"""
"Lindenmeyer said: ""He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.""
Madison said: ""Talk so I can understand.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.""
Madison said: ""Then fix it."""
"Sid 6.7 said: ""Don't be angry with me, Daryl.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?""
Sid 6.7 said: ""Should I have?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""Think hard -- it'll come to you..."""
"Lindenmeyer said: ""All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!""
Sid 6.7 said: ""True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""It was you, wasn't it?""
Sid 6.7 said: ""It was me, what?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!""
Sid 6.7 said: ""I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""My God...""
Sid 6.7 said: ""Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?""
Sid 6.7 said: ""I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?"""
"Sid 6.7 said: ""She's some of your finest work, Daryl.""
Lindenmeyer said: ""All my work is my finest."""

Lindenmeyer said: ""I think I understand what you have in mind..."""
"Lindenmeyer said: ""SID  NO!!!""
Sid 6.7 said: ""What do you expect me to do, thank him?"""
"Sid 6.7 said: ""I am beautiful, aren't I?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""Of course you are."""
"Sid 6.7 said: ""How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?""
Lindenmeyer said: ""Help me get out of here.""
Sid 6.7 said: ""Glad to..."""

Sid 6.7 said: ""Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever..."""
"Parker said: ""You actually listen to all those tapes?""
Madison said: ""No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?""
Parker said: ""A little less than yesterday.""
Madison said: ""In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?""
Parker said: ""John died.""
Madison said: ""I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.""
Parker said: ""You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.""
Madison said: ""That's not true, Parker.""
Parker said: ""If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.""
Madison said: ""What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?""
Parker said: ""Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.""
Madison said: ""You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...""
Parker said: ""Go to hell.""
Madison said: ""It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.""
Parker said: ""Enough!"""
"Madison said: ""I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.""
Parker said: ""I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that."""
"Parker said: ""I don't need a babysitter.""
Madison said: ""What you need is a collar."""
"Parker said: ""Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.""
Madison said: ""It wasn't a lie.""
Parker said: ""Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it."""
"Madison said: ""You all right?""
Parker said: ""Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar."""
"Madison said: ""You ready for this?""
Parker said: ""Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody."""
"Madison said: ""He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.""
Parker said: ""Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.""
Madison said: ""Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.""
Parker said: ""Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.""
Madison said: ""I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?""
Parker said: ""I know who would know."""
"Parker said: ""Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?""
Madison said: ""He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.""
Parker said: ""What happened when he was 17?""
Madison said: ""Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here."""
"Madison said: ""You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?""
Parker said: ""Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it."""
"Parker said: ""What are you doing?""
Madison said: ""Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?""
Parker said: ""You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?"""
"Madison said: ""This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.""
Parker said: ""Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him..."""
"Parker said: ""I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.""
Madison said: ""I'm still working on it."""
"Madison said: ""Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?""
Parker said: ""I've been in prison, remember?""
Madison said: ""The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.""
Parker said: ""Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one..."""
"Madison said: ""I am the demon from the bottomless pit...""
Parker said: ""... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.""
Madison said: ""I am impressed.""
Parker said: ""For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.""
Madison said: ""Who said that?""
Parker said: ""Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?""
Madison said: ""He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite."""
"Madison said: ""Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.""
Parker said: ""Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.""
Madison said: ""But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones."""
"Parker said: ""This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.""
Madison said: ""As a matter of fact, it is."""
"Parker said: ""Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?""
Madison said: ""Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.""
Parker said: ""What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.""
Madison said: ""In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick..."""
"Madison said: ""Give me your wrist.""
Parker said: ""Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.""

Madison said: ""How did you get your hand out?"""
"Parker said: ""Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?""
Madison said: ""I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.""
Parker said: ""She's beautiful, you know?""
Madison said: ""Thank-you.  Her name is Karin."""
"Parker said: ""Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?""
Madison said: ""I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.""
Parker said: ""You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?""
Madison said: ""Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.""
Parker said: ""What does that mean?""
Madison said: ""Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.""
Parker said: ""Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.""
Madison said: ""What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.""
Parker said: ""Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee."""
"Parker said: ""I forgot what real coffee tastes like...""
Madison said: ""You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...""
Parker said: ""Don't worry about it, all right?""
Madison said: ""Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...""
Parker said: ""Relax. I know what you meant.""
Madison said: ""I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.""
Parker said: ""Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?"""
"Madison said: ""Don't get out of the car.""
Parker said: ""Stop me."""
"Madison said: ""What the hell's going on?!""
Parker said: ""This is my area of expertise."""
"Madison said: ""What did you do to those people?""
Parker said: ""Nothing."""
"Parker said: ""Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?""
Madison said: ""Enjoying yourself?""
Parker said: ""You know I am.""
Madison said: ""This isn't a game, Parker!""
Parker said: ""Tell him."""
"Parker said: ""What's the problem?""
Madison said: ""I'm doing the best I can!"""
"Madison said: ""Whatever he was doing here was only the start.""
Parker said: ""Start of what?""
Madison said: ""I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished..."""
"Madison said: ""It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.""
Parker said: ""You like baseball?"""
"Parker said: ""Real effective security...""
Madison said: ""You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?""
Parker said: ""Authority still makes me nervous."""

Parker said: ""If you're gonna do it, better do it now."""
"Parker said: ""Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!""
Madison said: ""No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!"""
"Madison said: ""We know you didn't kill those guards.""
Parker said: ""They're going to fry me for it, anyway."""
"Madison said: ""He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.""
Parker said: ""You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?"""
"Madison said: ""How did you find out about the toxin?""
Parker said: ""Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.""
Madison said: ""You're not capable of it.""
Parker said: ""I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?""
Madison said: ""I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again."""
"Madison said: ""The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?""
Parker said: ""I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.""
Madison said: ""Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.""
Parker said: ""Part of him is."""
"Madison said: ""If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.""

"Madison said: ""Can I ask you something?""
Parker said: ""You mean there's something you haven't asked me?""
Madison said: ""You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?""
Parker said: ""You don't know?""
Madison said: ""That's why I'm asking.""
Parker said: ""Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7."""

Lisa said: ""Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite."""
"Lisa said: ""Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?""
Bud said: ""Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...""
Lisa said: ""I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?""
Bud said: ""Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield..."""
"Bud said: ""Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.""
Lisa said: ""So you're hot on this stock?""
Bud said: ""It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you."""
"Roger said: ""Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?""
Bud said: ""Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?""
Roger said: ""Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?""
Bud said: ""Nah, she asked the wrong question.""
Roger said: ""What was that?""
Bud said: """"What are you thinking?""...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.""
Roger said: ""So, does ""this guy"" have a tip for an honest lawyer?""
Bud said: ""Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.""
Roger said: ""Okay.""
Bud said: ""What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?""
Roger said: ""Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?""
Bud said: ""Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.""
Roger said: ""Yeah, right...""
Bud said: ""Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.""
Roger said: ""...and if I did, what's in it for moi?"""
"Bud said: ""More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?""
Roger said: ""Too much to do...but I'll walk you out."""
"Bud said: ""...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.""
Roger said: ""All right, Bud... let's do it."""
"Bud said: ""So what's the problem?""
Roger said: ""...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...""
Bud said: ""....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...""
Roger said: ""Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...""
Bud said: ""Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool."""
"Roger said: ""Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?""
Bud said: ""He never told me...""
Roger said: ""You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on."""
"Bud said: ""How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.""
Gekko said: ""So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?"""
"Gekko said: ""So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.""
Bud said: ""Oh no, no...""
Gekko said: ""Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.""
Bud said: ""I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...""
Gekko said: ""So what firm you with, pal?""
Bud said: ""Jackson, Steinem...""
Gekko said: ""...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.""
Bud said: ""...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.""
Gekko said: ""...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?""
Bud said: ""Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.""
Gekko said: ""So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?"""
"Bud said: ""Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.""
Gekko said: ""It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?"""
"Gekko said: ""...rings a bell somewhere. So what?""
Bud said: ""A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...""
Gekko said: ""...don't like airlines, lousy unions...""
Bud said: ""There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know."""
"Gekko said: ""How do you know?""
Bud said: ""I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop."""
"Bud said: ""My home number's on the back...""
Gekko said: ""Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one."""
"Gekko said: ""Hi sport.""
Bud said: ""Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko."""
"Gekko said: ""See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...""
Bud said: ""...I can't even see it...""
Gekko said: ""...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.""
Bud said: ""Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...""
Gekko said: ""Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.""
Bud said: ""No sir, that would've been illegal...""
Gekko said: ""Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?"""
"Bud said: ""Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.""
Gekko said: ""...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.""
Bud said: ""Excuse me sir."""
"Gekko said: ""...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...""
Bud said: ""Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.""
Gekko said: ""...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself..."""
"Bud said: ""Nice club, Mr. Gekko...""
Gekko said: ""Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!""
Bud said: ""Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand."""
"Gekko said: ""I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.""
Bud said: ""What? How do you know about my father?""
Gekko said: ""The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?""
Bud said: ""Yes..."""
"Gekko said: ""Know the name?""
Bud said: ""'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.""
Gekko said: ""Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.""
Bud said: ""I remember that deal. You were involved?"""
"Gekko said: ""Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...""
Bud said: ""I don't understand.""
Gekko said: ""Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...""
Bud said: ""Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?""
Gekko said: ""Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business..."""
"Bud said: ""What about hard work?""
Gekko said: ""What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being ""comfortable"", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??"""
"Bud said: ""I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.""
Gekko said: ""Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?"""
"Gekko said: ""I'll be right there, fix them a drink.""
Bud said: ""...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.""
Gekko said: ""You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.""
Bud said: ""My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.""
Gekko said: ""...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up."""
"Bud said: ""Sorry, Mr. Gekko.""
Gekko said: ""Allright. Wait here..."""
"Bud said: ""I guess I'll head back...""
Gekko said: ""Stick around... Larry, one of my ""gang"" -- Bud Fox."""
"Bud said: ""The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.""
Gekko said: ""But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72."""
"Gekko said: ""He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.""
Bud said: """"All warfare is based on deception..."" Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.""
Gekko said: ""You're learning, sport..."""
"Gekko said: ""Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.""
Bud said: ""Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.""
Gekko said: ""You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - ""a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar."" I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.""
Bud said: ""...Gordon.""
Gekko said: ""Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work."""
"Gekko said: ""Got him at an auction in Kentucky.""
Bud said: ""How much?""
Gekko said: ""Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals."""
"Gekko said: ""The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...""
Bud said: ""I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money..."""
"Gekko said: ""Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...""
Bud said: ""Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker..."""
"Bud said: ""Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!""
Gekko said: ""I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.""
Bud said: ""Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.""
Gekko said: ""What does that mean?""
Bud said: ""The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...""
Gekko said: ""What makes you think you can?""
Bud said: ""I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.""
Gekko said: ""Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more..."""
"Bud said: ""And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.""
Gekko said: ""A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox."""
"Bud said: ""Now, wait a minute, Dad...""
Gekko said: ""Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain."""
"Gekko said: ""I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.""
Bud said: ""I'm sorry, this can't wait."""
"Gekko said: ""What the hell do you want?""
Bud said: ""I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?"""
"Gekko said: ""Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.""
Bud said: ""Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.""
Gekko said: ""You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.""
Bud said: ""Why do you need to wreck this company?""
Gekko said: ""Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.""
Bud said: ""If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.""
Gekko said: ""It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.""
Bud said: ""Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?""
Gekko said: ""Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.""
Bud said: ""How much is enough Gordon?""
Gekko said: ""The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...""
Bud said: ""Obviously..."""
"Gekko said: ""Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...""
Bud said: ""...I can't make it tonight.""
Gekko said: ""Are you with me Buddy?"""
"Bud said: ""Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.""
Gekko said: ""Dump it."""
"Gekko said: ""Hello Bud.""
Bud said: ""Gordon.""
Gekko said: ""You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?"""
"Bud said: ""Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.""
Darien said: ""Excuse me.""
Bud said: ""Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.""
Darien said: ""Oh yes, I remember you.""
Bud said: ""Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.""
Darien said: ""Aha. Poet or philosopher?""
Bud said: ""Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?"""
"Darien said: ""I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.""
Bud said: ""...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.""
Darien said: ""Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.""
Bud said: ""You could have a great beach house for that.""
Darien said: ""Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.""
Bud said: ""Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.""
Darien said: ""Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.""
Bud said: ""I gather you're a decorator.""
Darien said: ""You got it, a great spender of other people's money.""
Bud said: ""Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.""
Darien said: ""Where is it?""
Bud said: ""Upper West Side.""
Darien said: ""Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.""
Bud said: ""Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo."""
"Darien said: ""What if I have a previous engagement?""
Bud said: ""Break it.""
Darien said: ""I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.""
Bud said: ""You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you."""
"Bud said: ""So. See you Friday.""
Darien said: ""You really do believe in destiny?""
Bud said: ""Only if I want something bad enough."""
"Bud said: ""Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?""
Darien said: ""He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.""
Bud said: ""How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five."""
"Darien said: ""If I could have anything... this would almost do.""
Bud said: ""Yeah, almost..."""
"Darien said: ""So, how did your conference go with Gordon?""
Bud said: ""The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.""
Darien said: ""You have modest wants. I like that in a man.""
Bud said: ""And what do you want?""
Darien said: ""...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...""
Bud said: ""Well, why stop at that?""
Darien said: ""I don't.""
Bud said: ""You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?"""
"Darien said: ""...isn't it perfect!""
Bud said: ""...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it."""
"Bud said: ""You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.""
Darien said: ""I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the ""demolished"" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.""
Bud said: ""Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable."""
"Darien said: ""Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...""
Bud said: ""I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.""
Darien said: ""You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.""
Bud said: ""That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside..."""
"Darien said: ""Do you think you're ready?""
Bud said: ""It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.""
Darien said: ""I'll let you know."""
"Bud said: ""Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...""
Darien said: ""...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.""
Bud said: ""You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker."""
"Bud said: ""I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?""
Darien said: ""Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much."""
"Bud said: ""Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.""
Darien said: ""You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...""
Bud said: ""...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...""
Darien said: ""So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?""
Bud said: ""Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride."""
"Darien said: ""I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.""
Bud said: ""Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...""
Darien said: ""Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.""
Bud said: ""I'm not gonna let it happen Darien."""
"Darien said: ""Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.""
Bud said: ""At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger."""
"Darien said: ""Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!""
Bud said: ""I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.""
Darien said: ""I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.""
Bud said: ""What the hell's that supposed to mean?"""
"Bud said: ""You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...""
Darien said: ""You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...""
Bud said: ""I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see."""
"Darien said: ""You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...""
Bud said: ""Get the hell out!"""
"Darien said: ""Hi.""
Bud said: ""Why?""
Darien said: ""I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own..."""
"Carolyn said: ""How you doing Buddy?""
Bud said: ""Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin..."""
"Carolyn said: ""Morning Buddy, you look happy.""
Bud said: ""Any better and I'd be guilty.""
Carolyn said: ""You were never that innocent sugarpie.""
Bud said: ""...how do you know? You wish..."""
"Carolyn said: ""Bud! Where you been the last two days?""
Bud said: ""...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent..."""
"Carolyn said: ""He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...""
Bud said: ""Oh Christ!"""
"Bud said: ""You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...""
Mannheim said: ""Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it."""
"Bud said: ""Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.""
Mannheim said: ""Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.""
Bud said: ""Old values. Buy."""
"Bud said: ""Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.""
Mannheim said: ""No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.""
Bud said: ""You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.""
Mannheim said: ""Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.""
Bud said: ""It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy."""
"Mannheim said: ""You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.""
Bud said: ""...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim."""
"Carl said: ""I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?""
Gekko said: ""Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?"""
"Gekko said: ""Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.""
Carl said: ""There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.""
Gekko said: ""I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?""
Carl said: ""No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ..."""
"Gekko said: ""Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.""
Carl said: ""...that ""scum"" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day..."""
"Gekko said: ""What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.""
Darien said: ""Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.""
Gekko said: ""Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought."""
"Gekko said: ""So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?""
Darien said: ""It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.""
Gekko said: ""Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.""
Darien said: ""It's over you, Gordon.""
Gekko said: ""You told him about us?""
Darien said: ""No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?..."""
"Darien said: ""I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.""
Gekko said: ""Now tell me, why would I want to do that?""
Darien said: ""Because I don't want to see him hurt.""
Gekko said: ""Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?""
Darien said: ""I can't...and I won't.""
Gekko said: ""Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.""
Darien said: ""Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.""
Gekko said: ""You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.""
Darien said: ""You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.""
Gekko said: ""Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of."""
"Gekko said: ""Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!""
Ollie said: ""You got it, G.G."""
"Gekko said: ""He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.""
Ollie said: ""He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake."""
"Ollie said: ""... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.""
Gekko said: ""Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.""
Ollie said: ""And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.""
Gekko said: ""Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?"""
"Gekko said: ""Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.""
Wildman said: ""Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.""
Gekko said: ""The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...""
Wildman said: ""No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers..."""
"Gekko said: ""You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the ""sir"" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...""
Wildman said: ""I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment."""
"Gekko said: ""Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.""
Wildman said: ""Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night."""
"Wilmore said: ""With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?""
Gekko said: ""Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut."""
"Wilmore said: ""Are you prepared to put that in writing?""
Gekko said: ""I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days."""
"Gekko said: ""Cards are on the table. What do you think?""
Wilmore said: ""If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people."""
"Wilmore said: ""We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.""
Gekko said: ""You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it."""
"Gekko said: ""Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!""
Wilmore said: ""We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko."""

The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.""

Sir Wilfred said: ""You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.""
Mark said: ""Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.

Mrs. Feur said: ""Very much."""
"Mrs. Feur said: ""Your house is so beautiful.""
Claire said: ""Thank you.""
Mrs. Feur said: ""And these roses.  They're much prettier up close."""
"Mrs. Feur said: ""No.""
Claire said: ""Of what?  What were you so afraid of?""
Mrs. Feur said: ""You're going to think I'm crazy or something."""
"Mrs. Feur said: ""Love.""
Claire said: ""What?""
Mrs. Feur said: ""Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?""
Claire said: ""Um...sure.""
Mrs. Feur said: ""I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home."""
"Mrs. Feur said: ""You must think I'm pathetic.""
Claire said: ""No.  No, I don't.""
Mrs. Feur said: ""I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends."""
"Claire said: ""Mrs. Frank?""
Mrs. Frank said: ""Yeah.""
Claire said: ""I'd like to talk to you about Madison.""
Mrs. Frank said: ""You know where she is?""
Claire said: ""No, I don't.""
Mrs. Frank said: ""Please leave me alone."""
"Mrs. Frank said: ""What's your name?""
Claire said: ""Claire.""
Mrs. Frank said: ""She never mentioned you."""
"Mrs. Frank said: ""Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.""
Claire said: ""It's fine."""
"Mrs. Frank said: ""You look a little old for a student.""
Claire said: ""I'm not.  We...we met at a party.""
Mrs. Frank said: ""Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.""
Claire said: ""She never mentioned her father.""
Mrs. Frank said: ""Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that."""
"Mrs. Frank said: ""Why are you here?""
Claire said: ""I don't know.""
Mrs. Frank said: ""It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened."""
"Mrs. Frank said: ""Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.""
Claire said: ""You must have been very proud."""
"Mrs. Frank said: ""They're calling me in to work.""
Claire said: ""I should be going anyway."""
"Mrs. Frank said: ""Y'hear anything you'll let me know?""
Claire said: ""Of course."""
"Claire said: ""What was her major?""
Mrs. Frank said: ""Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor."""
"Claire said: ""Wow.""
Elena said: ""This is...""
Claire said: ""We know each other."""
"Claire said: ""He looked like one of the Monkees.""
Elena said: ""Anyway, Claire slept with him...""
Claire said: ""I didn't sleep with him.""
Elena said: ""...just so she could cut them off.""
Claire said: ""He was so pissed.""
Elena said: ""I came in from my room...""
Claire said: ""We were suite mates.""
Elena said: ""And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.""
Claire said: ""Oh God..."""
"Elena said: ""You should have heard her play.""
Claire said: ""Stop.""
Elena said: ""We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.""
Claire said: ""Do we have to?""
Elena said: ""And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.""
Claire said: ""She's making this up.""
Elena said: ""I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks."""
"Elena said: ""She got it.  Turned it down.""
Claire said: ""I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night..."""
"Jody said: ""How you holding up?""
Claire said: ""Good.  I'm good.""
Jody said: ""You are?""
Claire said: ""Why does everyone find that so surprising?""
Jody said: ""Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...""
Claire said: ""Okay, I'm a little tender.""
Jody said: ""Well good.  So you're human.""
Claire said: ""And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.""
Jody said: ""Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this."""
"Claire said: ""What is it?""
Jody said: ""Kambucha mushroom tea...""
Claire said: ""Jody--""
Jody said: ""It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--""
Claire said: ""You're discussing me with your psychic?""
Jody said: ""She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.""
Claire said: ""Thanks, but I'm fine.""
Jody said: ""So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?"""
"Claire said: ""Oh my god.  You bought it.""
Jody said: ""Yep.""
Claire said: ""It's niiice.""
Jody said: ""Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?""
Claire said: ""Absolutely.""
Jody said: ""Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?""
Claire said: ""You got it."""
"Jody said: ""You think he killed her?""
Claire said: ""I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?"""
"Jody said: ""Know what I think?""
Claire said: ""What?""
Jody said: ""Seance.""
Claire said: ""Jody, no...""
Jody said: ""Telling you...""
Claire said: ""...no...no...no...""
Jody said: ""Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.""
Claire said: ""Please.  That's all I need."""
"Claire said: ""Someone's there.""
Jody said: ""What?""
Claire said: ""In the window.  Norman's at work.""
Jody said: ""I don't..."""
"Claire said: ""Wow.  I'm losing it.""
Jody said: ""No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly."""
"Jody said: ""Sit down here.""
Claire said: ""Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?"""
"Jody said: ""Place your fingers on the planchette.""
Claire said: ""The planchette?""
Jody said: ""This."""
"Jody said: ""We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?""
Claire said: ""I don't know."""
"Claire said: ""Nothing's happening.""
Jody said: ""Shhh."""
"Claire said: ""Oh...""
Jody said: ""M-E..."""
"Jody said: ""Mef?  What's Mef?""
Claire said: ""It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her."""
"Jody said: ""I have to go.""
Claire said: ""Jody, wait."""
"Jody said: ""Are you okay?""
Claire said: ""I think so""
Jody said: ""I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...""
Claire said: ""It's alright.""
Jody said: ""I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen."""
"Jody said: ""Does Norman know?""
Claire said: ""Jody, she's alive.""
Jody said: ""What?""
Claire said: ""Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.""
Jody said: ""Then what was it?""
Claire said: ""Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--""
Jody said: ""Something was there.  You saw it.""
Claire said: ""Did I?""
Jody said: ""Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...""
Claire said: ""Hartford?""
Jody said: ""And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.""
Claire said: ""No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.""
Jody said: ""But Claire--""
Claire said: ""Please."""
"Jody said: ""Okay.  Okay.""
Claire said: ""I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you."""
"Claire said: ""Oh God...you knew.""
Jody said: ""I was down in Adamant...""
Claire said: ""Adamant?""
Jody said: ""Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe."""
"Jody said: ""I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.""
Claire said: ""Why?""
Jody said: ""Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.""
Claire said: ""Relieved?""
Jody said: ""I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed."""
"Jody said: ""By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.""
Claire said: ""Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.""
Jody said: ""Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?"""
"Jody said: ""I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.""
Claire said: ""All of us."""
"Jody said: ""I'm a terrible friend.""
Claire said: ""No."""
"Claire said: ""How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?""
Jody said: ""What are you going to do?""
Claire said: ""I don't know.""
Jody said: ""If she was dangerous before--""
Claire said: ""She could have hurt me if she wanted to.""
Jody said: ""You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.""
Claire said: ""No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace."""
"Claire said: ""Jody, she tried to kill him.""
Jody said: ""I know.""
Claire said: ""I can't believe this is happening.""
Jody said: ""We need help.  Please let me call the medium.""
Claire said: ""That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead."""
"Jody said: ""Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.""
Claire said: ""Like what?""
Jody said: ""I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...""
Claire said: ""What is it?"""
"Claire said: ""But he acted like he'd never heard of it.""
Jody said: ""Did he say that?""
Claire said: ""Jody he was lying.""
Jody said: ""What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?""
Claire said: ""I guess not.""
Jody said: ""He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too."""
"Jody said: ""You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.""
Claire said: ""I don't know...""
Jody said: ""Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go."""
"Norman said: ""Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?""
Claire said: ""I think three...""
Norman said: ""Three weeks."""
"Claire said: ""What's their name?""
Norman said: ""Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic."""
"Claire said: ""She's awake.""
Norman said: ""We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet."""
"Norman said: ""When's she out of here?""
Claire said: ""Norman Spencer."""
"Norman said: ""Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.""
Claire said: ""Don't.""
Norman said: ""Claire, I have to show up for the--""
Claire said: ""It's Saturday."""
"Norman said: ""It's today?""
Claire said: ""Yep."""
"Norman said: ""Claire?""
Claire said: ""Three o'clock."""
"Norman said: ""Whatcha reading?""
Claire said: ""Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.""
Norman said: ""How is it?"""
"Claire said: ""Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.""
Norman said: ""Nice.  Almost done."""
"Claire said: ""If you have to work...""
Norman said: ""No, no.  I'm just about...  There."""
"Norman said: ""How are you?""
Claire said: ""Fine.""
Norman said: ""It's okay if you're not.""
Claire said: ""I am, really.""
Norman said: ""It's just she's been the focus for a while.""
Claire said: ""Not the focus.""
Norman said: ""You know what I mean."""
"Claire said: ""To tell you the truth...I'm excited.""
Norman said: ""You are...""
Claire said: ""To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us."""
"Norman said: ""You did a great job.  She's a good kid.""
Claire said: ""We did."""
"Norman said: ""It's just us now.""
Claire said: ""I know."""
"Norman said: ""Tired?""
Claire said: ""Nope.""
Norman said: ""Wanna fool around?""
Claire said: ""Yup."""
"Norman said: ""Did you...""
Claire said: ""Shhh."""
"Norman said: ""And we moved out here for the quiet.""
Claire said: ""Mmm."""
"Norman said: ""Maybe we should just...""
Claire said: ""Tomorrow.""
Norman said: ""I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.""
Claire said: ""After that.""
Norman said: ""I'll be there."""
"Norman said: ""Of what?""
Claire said: ""Of him I think.""
Norman said: ""Did she say that?""
Claire said: ""More or less."""
"Norman said: ""Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.""
Claire said: ""I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...""
Norman said: ""Remember how we were?""
Claire said: ""Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--""
Norman said: ""Why?""
Claire said: ""To make sure she's all right."""
"Norman said: ""Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--""
Claire said: ""That's not what I'm sug--""
Norman said: ""...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.""
Claire said: ""But what if something happens?""
Norman said: ""Claire...""
Claire said: ""I'd never be able to live with mysel--""
Norman said: ""Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...""
Claire said: ""I know.""
Norman said: ""It's what I've been working for."""
"Claire said: ""I just wish you could have heard her.""
Norman said: ""Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.""
Claire said: ""Promise?"""
"Claire said: ""Norman, you have to look at this!""
Norman said: ""Mmnph.""
Claire said: ""Hurry..."""
"Claire said: ""Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.""
Norman said: ""Is it gone?"""
"Claire said: ""Hi.""
Norman said: ""I'm stuck here for another couple of hours."""
"Claire said: ""Oh.""
Norman said: ""Unless you need me to come home...""
Claire said: ""No, no.  It's fine."""
"Norman said: ""Claire?""
Claire said: ""Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time."""
"Norman said: ""What are you doing here?""
Claire said: ""There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you."""
"Norman said: ""What do you mean?  Some noises where?""
Claire said: ""In the house.  I was scared.""
Norman said: ""Did you call the police?""
Claire said: ""No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.""
Norman said: ""Of course."""
"Claire said: ""It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.""
Norman said: ""What kind of whispering?""
Claire said: ""I don't know.  Just...whispering."""
"Norman said: ""I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.""
Claire said: ""I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?"""
"Norman said: ""Think I may have cracked it.""
Claire said: ""Really?"""
"Norman said: ""I think so.  Maybe.""
Claire said: ""You are so brilliant.""
Norman said: ""Yep.""
Claire said: ""Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...""
Norman said: ""You know what that does to me."""
"Norman said: ""Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...""
Claire said: ""You're kidding.""
Norman said: ""He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...""
Claire said: ""Wow."""
"Norman said: ""And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, ""Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work...""""
Claire said: ""Well, that's nice.""
Norman said: """"...especially Spencer's Theorem...""""
Claire said: ""Oh, no...""
Norman said: """"...of Perpetual Distances.""  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  ""I'm afraid you've mistaken me,""  I say...""
Claire said: ""That's...""
Norman said: """"...for my father.""""
Claire said: ""I'm so sorry.""
Norman said: ""Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.""
Claire said: ""That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.""
Norman said: ""Did you tell her?""
Claire said: ""What?  No.  No.""
Norman said: ""You didn't?""
Claire said: ""Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't."""
"Norman said: ""Sorry.  You understand.""
Claire said: ""Did you call about the Feurs?""
Norman said: ""Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.""
Claire said: ""Huh."""
"Claire said: ""Get down!  He'll see.""
Norman said: ""What's going on, Claire?""
Claire said: ""Shhhh."""
"Claire said: ""He killed her.""
Norman said: ""What?""
Claire said: ""He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.""
Norman said: ""And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--""
Claire said: ""No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this."""
"Norman said: ""Our house.""
Claire said: ""No.  Look!  In the window."""
"Norman said: ""It's a flare.""
Claire said: ""A flare?""
Norman said: ""From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.""
Claire said: ""It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!""
Norman said: ""It's a ghost."""
"Claire said: ""Where is she then?""
Norman said: ""She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.""
Claire said: ""Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this."""
"Claire said: ""See?""
Norman said: ""What am I looking at?""
Claire said: ""I didn't do that.""
Norman said: ""Who did?  Mrs. Feur?""
Claire said: ""Maybe.  Point is...not me.""
Norman said: ""Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?""
Claire said: ""She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--""
Norman said: ""Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?""
Claire said: ""Dressed?""
Norman said: ""Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.""
Claire said: ""When?""
Norman said: ""What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...""
Claire said: ""Oh.""
Norman said: ""...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?""
Claire said: ""Tonight?""
Norman said: ""Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--"""

"Claire said: ""What are you doing?""
Norman said: ""Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.""
Claire said: ""Five minutes?"""
"Claire said: ""You're not at the center.""
Norman said: ""I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.""
Claire said: ""We're going to be fine."""
"Norman said: ""There we go.""
Claire said: ""Well, that's a relief."""
"Claire said: ""I don't need a shrink.""
Norman said: ""Harvey says he's amazing.""
Claire said: ""Norman...""
Norman said: ""What can it hurt to talk to someone?"""
"Norman said: ""Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.""
Claire said: ""I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some ""symptom"" of something...""
Norman said: ""I never said...""
Claire said: ""...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up."""
"Norman said: ""Are you lonely?""
Claire said: ""No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!"""
"Norman said: ""What are you doing out here?""
Claire said: ""He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--""
Norman said: ""This is the Feur thing?""
Claire said: ""Yes.  And he's going to get away with it."""
"Norman said: ""How do you know this?""
Claire said: ""We had a seance.""
Norman said: ""Who did?""
Claire said: ""Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.""
Norman said: ""How did you--""
Claire said: ""Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her."""
"Claire said: ""What?""
Norman said: ""Maybe you resent how busy I've been.""
Claire said: ""What are you...?  No.""
Norman said: ""You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.""
Claire said: ""Sabotage?""
Norman said: ""Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...""
Claire said: ""The accident...?""
Norman said: ""But then you've been so much better...""
Claire said: ""Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...""
Norman said: ""Sweetheart--""
Claire said: ""No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you."""
"Norman said: ""Keep your voice down.""
Claire said: ""I will NOT."""
"Claire said: ""Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...""
Norman said: ""Claire, please..."""
"Norman said: ""I'm sorry...""
Claire said: ""Then where is she?"""
"Norman said: ""...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?""
Claire said: ""No, it's fine.  I'm fine.""
Norman said: ""Really big bed."""
"Norman said: ""Do I have everything?""
Claire said: ""Yep.""
Norman said: ""Call ya later."""
"Norman said: ""What?""
Claire said: ""Are you glad?  I'm glad."""
"Norman said: ""You know I am.""
Claire said: ""Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there..."""
"Norman said: ""You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...""
Claire said: ""I felt you...looking through me...""
Norman said: ""We walked all night...""
Claire said: ""You told me that I was..."""
"Norman said: ""You don't remember?""
Claire said: ""When she said it, there was something familiar...but no."""
"Norman said: ""You dropped a glass.""
Claire said: ""I...""
Norman said: ""A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...""
Claire said: ""In the living room...""
Norman said: ""You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.""
Claire said: ""But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--""
Norman said: ""It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.""
Claire said: ""But I don't remember.""
Norman said: ""Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.""
Claire said: ""What's wrong with me?"""
"Norman said: ""I may have seen her on campus.""
Claire said: ""Not personally.""
Norman said: ""No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.""
Claire said: ""It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.""
Norman said: ""The...""
Claire said: ""Yes.  The ghost."""

Steckler said: ""Why whats wrong with the sugar -"""
"Carter said: ""I haven't been using it recently LESLIE""

Carter said: ""Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...""
Steckler said: ""WAIT FOR WHAT!?"""

Carter said: ""You killed my friend!"""

Mik said: ""I don't know - it's your house ELLEN""
Carter said: ""Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?""
Mik said: ""I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly."""

Mik said: ""What?""

Carter said: ""What's this all about?""
Taylor said: ""So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?"""
"Carter said: ""What brings the rats out of the sewers?""
Taylor said: ""I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...""
Carter said: ""You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?"""

Carter said: ""At home alone - where were you?""
Taylor said: ""As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?""

Steckler said: ""No - she isn't in any trouble is she?""

"Charlie said: ""Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...""
Ted said: ""You and your pep talks.""
Charlie said: ""Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.""
Ted said: ""That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer..."""
"Ted said: ""I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.""
Charlie said: ""That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again."""
"Ted said: ""See? Did you see that?""
Charlie said: ""She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas."""
"Charlie said: ""The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  ""Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex."" Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.""
Ted said: ""Were you always this sick?""
Charlie said: ""One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked."""
"Ted said: ""Someday, I'll find out.""
Charlie said: ""You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip."""
"Ted said: ""I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.""
Charlie said: ""That's crazy talk.""
Ted said: ""I defy any and all limits."""
"Charlie said: ""Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.""
Ted said: ""Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself."""
"Charlie said: ""Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.""
Ted said: ""Poor Freud, turning in his grave.""
Charlie said: ""Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.""
Ted said: ""Nobody knows about your mental retardation.""
Charlie said: ""Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.""
Ted said: ""Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.""
Charlie said: ""And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding..."""
"Charlie said: ""What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?""
Ted said: ""Astronomical."""
"Charlie said: ""Who the hell was your father?""
Ted said: ""Well, Dad said..."""
"Charlie said: ""...A bouncer? Are you serious?""
Ted said: ""Maybe he got promoted."""
"Charlie said: ""This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!""
Ted said: ""Cut it out, before you break something!""
Charlie said: ""For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight."""
"Charlie said: ""Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.""
Ted said: ""Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.""
Charlie said: ""And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out."""
"Charlie said: ""I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.""
Ted said: ""Perv."""
"Charlie said: ""This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.""
Ted said: ""Be cool. Fake it if you have to."""
"Charlie said: ""I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?""
Ted said: ""This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.""
Charlie said: ""Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.""
Ted said: ""Not ever. Never."""
"Ted said: ""You kiss your mother with that mouth?""
Charlie said: ""I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know..."""
"Ted said: ""So far away? In Xenia?""
Charlie said: ""Yeah, whatever."""
"Charlie said: ""Check this out.  Hurry!""
Ted said: ""I better go, Dad."""
"Charlie said: ""Hurry.""
Ted said: ""What is it now?""
Charlie said: ""Check it out!"""
"Ted said: ""Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?""
Charlie said: ""Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS."""
"Ted said: ""I get it now. You and me. We're dead.""
Charlie said: ""Dead?""
Ted said: ""Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.""
Charlie said: ""Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.""
Ted said: ""And some really fast cars."""
"Charlie said: ""Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.""
Ted said: ""It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.""
Charlie said: ""I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK."""
"Ted said: ""I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...""
Charlie said: ""...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable."""
"Ted said: ""Oh, how inappropriate is that!""
Charlie said: ""Take a whiff of heaven.""
Ted said: ""How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?""
Charlie said: ""I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--""
Ted said: ""Give me those!"""
"Charlie said: ""A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.""
Ted said: ""Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies."""
"Charlie said: ""You're late, bro!""
Ted said: ""Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.""
Charlie said: ""You'll never believe who's in there.""
Ted said: ""It better not be my Aunt Trudy."""
"Ted said: ""I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.""
Charlie said: ""With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip."""
"Ted said: ""I thought I loved her.""
Charlie said: ""Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner."""
"Ted said: ""Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!""
Charlie said: ""No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.""
Ted said: ""And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.""
Charlie said: ""I love those springy head puppies!"""
"Ted said: ""Get them together.""
Charlie said: ""Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk."""
"Charlie said: ""Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?""
Ted said: ""We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.""
Charlie said: ""Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold."""
"Charlie said: ""You got everything you ever wanted.""
Ted said: ""Except the girl. The only one that really mattered."""
"Charlie said: ""Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called ""Heaven.""""
Uncle Billy said: ""This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""Never say never.""
Charlie said: ""Oh, god.  Look. Look."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.""
Charlie said: ""Let me get this straight...""
Uncle Billy said: ""If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.""
Charlie said: ""These are real, live women?""
Uncle Billy said: ""We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.""
Charlie said: ""God, I love being dead."""
"Julie said: ""What gives, Don Corleone?""
Charlie said: ""We reinvented ourselves.""
Julie said: ""New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.""
Charlie said: ""You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.""
Julie said: ""That explains the emptiness that haunts me.""
Charlie said: ""Jealousy is so unattractive."""
"Julie said: ""Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.""
Charlie said: ""He kicked major ass and you know it."""
"Christy said: ""Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?""
Ted said: ""From your lips, to God's ears.""
Christy said: ""You go first.""
Ted said: ""Ladies first.  I insist.""
Christy said: ""Well. The prom's coming up.""
Ted said: ""Yeah?""
Christy said: ""And I was wondering.""
Ted said: ""Yeah?""
Christy said: ""If you don't have...I mean..."""
"Christy said: ""Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?""
Ted said: ""SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course."""
"Christy said: ""Ted, have you lost your mind?""
Ted said: ""You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.""
Christy said: ""I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.""
Ted said: ""But that smile.""
Christy said: ""Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.""
Ted said: ""So you'll think about it?"""
"Christy said: ""You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!""
Ted said: ""So that's a maybe?""
Christy said: ""The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams."""
"Christy said: ""Great jacket, Teddy Bear.""
Ted said: ""Yeah? You like?""
Christy said: ""Makes your shoulders look so big and broad."""
"Christy said: ""Hi, Teddy Bear.""
Ted said: ""Christy?  You want to be in ""Heaven?""""
Christy said: ""I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible."""
"Christy said: ""I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.""
Ted said: ""I do? I mean, yeah, I do.""
Christy said: ""I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.""
Ted said: ""Do it?""
Christy said: ""You know...take the pictures?"""
"Ted said: ""I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.""
Christy said: ""Which you pulled, hard!""
Ted said: ""That was code for ""I like you."""""
"Christy said: ""Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.""
Ted said: ""I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.""
Christy said: ""Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself."""
"Christy said: ""Well?""
Ted said: ""You have changed since second grade.""
Christy said: ""I mean, what do you think?""
Ted said: ""You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.""
Christy said: ""Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny."""
"Christy said: ""I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.""
Ted said: ""Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.""
Christy said: ""Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?"""
"Ted said: ""God, you are so hot.""
Christy said: ""Then you better get in the water, before you get burned."""
"Mom said: ""We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.""
Dad said: ""We own a small family grocery store."""
"Mom said: ""We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?""
Dad said: ""Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but..."""
"Mom said: ""Sweetheart, what is it?""
Dad said: ""I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.""
Mom said: ""Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance."""
"Dad said: ""Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.""
Mom said: ""We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.""
Dad said: ""We love our lives just the way they are."""
"Mom said: ""You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.""
Dad said: ""But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.""
Mom said: ""Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?"""
"Mom said: ""We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called ""flesh parties"" you attend. But we can get past all that.""
Dad said: ""We miss you. We miss our son.""
Mom said: ""We miss our family."""
"Dad said: ""We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.""
Mom said: ""We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after."""
"Dad said: ""We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.""
Ted said: ""It's my private business! Mine!"""
"Dad said: ""I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.""
Ted said: ""Dad, please.""
Dad said: ""Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.""
Ted said: ""Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?""
Dad said: ""You're way ahead of me again?""
Ted said: ""It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.""
Dad said: ""The lesson being?""
Ted said: ""Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.""
Dad said: ""I'm getting so good at this."""
"Ted said: ""You guys are my parents.""
Dad said: ""Of course we are.""
Ted said: ""They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care..."""
"Dad said: ""Son.""
Ted said: ""Well, why should I?""
Dad said: ""They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.""
Ted said: ""I guess.""
Dad said: ""They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.""
Ted said: ""Yeah.""
Dad said: ""Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?""
Ted said: ""I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.""
Dad said: ""Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.""
Ted said: ""Like one of those ""National Geographic"" specials with the topless chicks?""
Dad said: ""Whatever helps you cope.""
Ted said: ""I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.""
Dad said: ""There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...""
Ted said: ""...not the pit."""
"Dad said: ""Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.""
Ted said: ""Just say it, Dad.""
Dad said: ""I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?""
Ted said: ""Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.""
Dad said: ""Well, good. Every little bit helps."""
"Ted said: ""Finally, some gratitude.""
Dad said: ""We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true."""
"Dad said: ""But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.""
Ted said: ""Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives."""
"Dad said: ""Sorry I--""
Ted said: ""It's okay. You need me?""
Dad said: ""Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores."""
"Ted said: ""I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?""
Dad said: ""You ordered a Winnebago?"""
"Ted said: ""THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.""
Dad said: ""Watch your tone, mister.""
Ted said: ""Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore."""
"Ted said: ""Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.""
Dad said: ""I will not have my boys arguing."""
"Ted said: ""I-I don't have the keys.""
Ginger said: ""They're in the ignition, silly."""
"Ginger said: ""You do know how to drive?""
Ted said: ""I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.""
Ginger said: ""Want a lesson?"""
"Ginger said: ""Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.""
Ted said: ""Got it."""
"Ginger said: ""The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.""
Ted said: ""I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.""
Ginger said: ""It's your car. These are all your cars.""
Ted said: ""Some of them have to be automatics.""
Ginger said: ""Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. ""Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."""""
"Ted said: ""I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.""
Ginger said: ""I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.""
Ted said: ""The one with the horses.""
Ginger said: ""That's me.""
Ted said: ""I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs."""
"Ginger said: ""Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?""
Ted said: ""Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.""
Ginger said: ""Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.""
Ted said: ""Hi ho, Silver."""
"Ginger said: ""Who exactly ARE you?""
Ted said: ""What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.""
Ginger said: ""And who IS Ted Nelson?"""
"Ginger said: ""Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.""
Ted said: ""I always knew there was more. I felt it.""
Ginger said: ""Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS."""
"Ginger said: ""Teddy? I was thinking.""
Ted said: ""Hmmm?""
Ginger said: ""After graduation...maybe we could go away together?""
Ted said: ""Whatever you want."""
"Ginger said: ""Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.""
Ted said: ""Of course we were."""
"Ginger said: ""Ted! Do something!""
Ted said: ""What do you want me to do?""
Ginger said: ""This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!""
Ted said: ""Hang in there, I'll think of something."""
"Ginger said: ""Well?""
Ted said: ""I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted."""
"Heather said: ""Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!""
Tom said: ""But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.""
Heather said: ""But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.""
Tom said: ""If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?"""
"Heather said: ""But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.""
Tom said: ""We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this."""
"Heather said: ""Can you believe that was me?""
Tom said: ""Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.""
Heather said: ""So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.""
Tom said: ""Everything."""
"Ted said: ""You're on the next plane home.""
Helen said: ""I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary."""
"Ted said: ""No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?""
Helen said: ""We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can."""
"Helen said: ""It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.""
Ted said: ""Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal."""
"Helen said: ""Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.""
Ted said: ""You mean they knew who I was?""
Helen said: ""They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them."""
"Ted said: ""I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.""
Helen said: ""Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded ""Heaven,"" they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.""
Ted said: ""My legacy.""
Helen said: ""Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.""
Ted said: ""They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.""
Helen said: ""I understand.""
Ted said: ""And the girl I love, she hates ""Heaven."" If I keep it, she'll never respect me.""
Helen said: ""But how can you respect yourself if you don't?"""
"Jay said: ""How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?""
Ted said: ""Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.""
Jay said: ""Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?"""
"Ted said: ""I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.""
Jay said: ""What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in ""Heaven?"""""
"Ted said: ""Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of ""beauty.""""
Jay said: ""I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?""
Ted said: ""Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, ""The Girls of Xenia."" Just to show my appreciation."""
"Jimmy said: ""Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.""
Ted said: ""Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!"""
"Ted said: ""James, what are you doing here?""
Jimmy said: ""You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.""
Ted said: ""Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?""
Jimmy said: ""She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.""
Ted said: ""It's really late...do your parents know where you are?"""
"Jimmy said: ""Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.""
Ted said: ""Most places are, Jimmy.""
Jimmy said: ""They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.""
Ted said: ""So, what brings you here at his hour?""
Jimmy said: ""My new bike.""
Ted said: ""Very funny.""
Jimmy said: ""I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.""
Ted said: ""My room?""
Jimmy said: ""Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.""
Ted said: ""It's not up to me.""
Jimmy said: ""Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.""
Ted said: ""You can have it, then. I'm not going back there."""
"Jimmy said: ""If you could just sign right there.""
Ted said: ""You want it in writing?""
Jimmy said: ""Just a formality."""
"Ted said: ""That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.""
Jimmy said: ""Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.""
Ted said: ""Are they okay?""
Jimmy said: ""Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.""
Ted said: ""I miss them, too.""
Jimmy said: ""You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.""
Ted said: ""You're a peach.""
Jimmy said: ""Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer."""
"Ted said: ""He was my Grandfather, too.""
Jimmy said: ""I meant biologically.""
Ted said: ""That's a crappy thing to say.""
Jimmy said: ""Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy."""
"Jimmy said: ""But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.""
Ted said: ""I didn't forget.""
Jimmy said: ""You ever look down on them again and call them ""grocers"" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?"""
"Ted said: ""Great.""
Jimmy said: ""From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big."""
"Julie said: ""So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.""
Ted said: ""That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.""
Julie said: ""Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!""
Ted said: ""The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up."""
"Julie said: ""Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?""
Ted said: ""Look, I loved ""Exposed!"" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD."""
"Julie said: ""Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.""
Ted said: ""Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.""
Julie said: ""I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.""
Ted said: ""Me-ow.""
Julie said: ""Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.""
Ted said: ""I have absolutely no intention--""
Julie said: ""--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you."""
"Julie said: ""I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.""
Ted said: ""But you triple-dog-dared me.""
Julie said: ""It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way."""
"Julie said: ""A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.""
Ted said: ""It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy."""
"Julie said: ""What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?""
Ted said: ""Your article sucked.""
Julie said: ""In what sense?""
Ted said: ""In the sense that there is no ""hidden agenda"" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.""
Julie said: ""Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.""
Ted said: ""Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.""
Julie said: ""Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.""
Ted said: ""I'm trying to help.""
Julie said: ""I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.""
Ted said: ""That's not ENTIRELY true."""
"Ted said: ""What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.""
Julie said: ""Then I'll write about YOU.""
Ted said: ""Me?""
Julie said: """"Local boy inherits more money than god."" Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.""
Ted said: ""Really? You wanna write about me?"""
"Ted said: ""I have to admit, I always felt... different.""
Julie said: ""Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?""
Ted said: ""I don't get the distinction.""
Julie said: ""Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?""
Ted said: ""I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.""
Julie said: ""I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.""
Ted said: ""I guess.""
Julie said: ""Interesting."""
"Julie said: ""She said peanuts, you cretin.""
Ted said: ""You never know around here."""
"Ted said: ""Don't write that part.""
Julie said: ""Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?""
Ted said: ""Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.""
Julie said: ""Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.""
Ted said: ""Funny you should say ""peachy.""""
Julie said: ""I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.""
Ted said: ""My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.""
Julie said: ""Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort."""
"Ted said: ""Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.""
Julie said: ""I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.""
Ted said: ""See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.""
Julie said: ""And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.""
Ted said: ""A little respect would be nice, that's all."""
"Ted said: ""Well? What do you think of her?""
Julie said: ""You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.""
Ted said: ""You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?"""
"Ted said: ""Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.""
Julie said: ""Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.""
Ted said: ""Why can't you be nice to me?""
Julie said: ""You've got enough people kissing your ass."""
"Ted said: ""Wow...you clean up nice.""
Julie said: ""Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in."""
"Ted said: ""Where are we going?""
Julie said: ""To the best hiding place in the world."""
"Ted said: ""I can't believe your dad built this for you.""
Julie said: ""He didn't. He had it built.""
Ted said: ""Whatever.""
Julie said: ""Not ""whatever.""  It's two different things.""
Ted said: ""He cared enough to want you to have it.""
Julie said: ""He phoned it in.""
Ted said: ""I see.""
Julie said: ""I doubt it.""
Ted said: ""Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.""
Julie said: ""The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.""
Ted said: ""You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?""
Julie said: ""Your dad taught you everything.""
Ted said: ""I mean my father.""
Julie said: ""A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.""
Ted said: ""It's all so complicated.""
Julie said: ""It's incredibly simple.""
Ted said: ""I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.""
Julie said: ""Eventually you'll let go.""
Ted said: ""And then what?""
Julie said: ""Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.""
Ted said: ""You're amazing.""
Julie said: ""I know.""
Ted said: ""Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.""
Julie said: ""But you never do.""
Ted said: ""If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything."""
"Julie said: ""Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.""
Ted said: ""In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.""
Julie said: ""That's two words. And I'm out of the ""exposed"" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.""
Ted said: ""There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.""
Julie said: ""You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.""
Ted said: ""He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!"""
"Julie said: ""A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.""
Ted said: ""Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week..."""
"Ted said: ""That's probably my office.""
Julie said: ""Well? Where the hell are you?""
Ted said: ""He's on the move?""
Julie said: ""I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.""
Ted said: ""Let's do it."""
"Ted said: ""I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.""
Julie said: ""You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?""
Ted said: ""At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.""
Julie said: ""Amen to that."""
"Ted said: ""Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.""
Julie said: ""I'm trembling with excitement.""
Ted said: ""That has more to do with your proximity to me.""
Julie said: ""My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.""
Ted said: ""I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.""
Julie said: ""I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.""
Ted said: ""Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.""
Julie said: ""Wearing them?  Or humping them?""
Ted said: ""My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.""
Julie said: ""That's refreshingly deviant.""
Ted said: ""What about you?""
Julie said: ""I'm very aural.""
Ted said: ""Tell me more.""
Julie said: ""Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.""
Ted said: ""I see.""
Julie said: ""I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.""
Ted said: ""A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very ""Cosmo.""""
Julie said: ""You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.""
Ted said: ""Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.""
Julie said: ""You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever."""
"Ted said: ""Do you trust me, Julie?""
Julie said: ""Not a chance.""
Ted said: ""Come on.""
Julie said: ""Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire."""
"Ted said: ""I want you to trust me.""
Julie said: ""Maybe someday.""
Ted said: ""Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.""
Julie said: ""That's hard to believe.""
Ted said: ""But absolutely true."""
"Julie said: ""I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise ""The Girls of Xenia.""""
Ted said: ""I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.""
Julie said: ""I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.""
Ted said: ""Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor."""
"Julie said: ""You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.""
Ted said: ""You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.""
Julie said: ""Which explains the continued success of ""Heaven"" for how many decades?""
Ted said: ""You're quick. I like that.""
Julie said: ""You think you're working with chimps here?""
Ted said: ""The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.""
Julie said: ""Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted."""
"Ted said: ""Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.""
Julie said: ""I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.""
Ted said: ""I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know."""
"Ted said: ""And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a ""coxswain.""""
Julie said: ""Very ambitious. I like that.""
Ted said: ""The thing is, I'll need a first mate.""
Julie said: ""I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board."""
"Julie said: ""Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?""
Ted said: ""I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called ""EXPOSED!""  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio."""
"Julie said: ""I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.""
Ted said: ""Yellow pages?""
Julie said: ""Let your fingers do the walking."""
"Ted said: ""They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?""
Julie said: ""You better."""
"Ted said: ""What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?""
Mom said: ""No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.""
Ted said: ""I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!"""
"Mom said: ""That's part of growing up, honey.""
Ted said: ""What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?"""
"Mom said: ""What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.""
Ted said: ""Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?"""
"Ted said: ""I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.""
Mom said: ""Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?""
Ted said: ""Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.""
Mom said: ""Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.""
Ted said: ""It's okay, Mom.  Trust me."""
"Ted said: ""Well? Surprised?""
Mom said: ""What is all this? When are you coming home?""
Ted said: ""Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.""
Mom said: ""Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.""
Ted said: ""Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from."""
"Mom said: ""Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?""
Ted said: ""Only the best for my mother.""
Mom said: ""You promise you'll finish school?""
Ted said: ""I'll make you very proud."""
"Ted said: ""You don't have to work another day in your lives.""
Mom said: ""But how would we pay our bills?"""
"Ted said: ""Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.""
Mom said: ""Oh. Goodness.""
Ted said: ""You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!""
Mom said: ""Like what?""
Ted said: ""Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance."""
"Mom said: ""But who would run the store?""
Ted said: ""Forget the store. Think big."""
"Ted said: ""Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?""
Mom said: ""Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much."""
"Ted said: ""I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.""
Mom said: ""Don't say ""shit,"" honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you."""
"Principal Merkin said: ""I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.""
Ted said: ""Thanks, Principal Merkin.""
Principal Merkin said: ""I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.""
Ted said: ""Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.""
Principal Merkin said: ""Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.""
Ted said: ""You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?""
Principal Merkin said: ""That's a good start, yes. A very good start.""
Ted said: ""Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.""
Principal Merkin said: ""I never figured you for a pimp.""
Ted said: ""Have you ever even looked at ""Heaven?""""
Principal Merkin said: ""What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.""
Ted said: ""I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?"""
"Ted said: ""With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?""
Principal Merkin said: ""We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!""
Ted said: ""If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in ""Heaven"" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress."""
"Ted said: ""Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.""
Principal Merkin said: ""Rules are rules.""
Ted said: ""Come on, it's our only senior prom.""
Principal Merkin said: ""Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power."""
"Principal Merkin said: ""You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.""
Ted said: ""A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?""
Principal Merkin said: ""I'm warning you.""
Ted said: ""A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything."""
"Ted said: ""You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.""
Principal Merkin said: ""Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.""
Ted said: ""What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?""
Principal Merkin said: ""Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.""
Ted said: ""You called the cops on us?""
Principal Merkin said: ""Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?""
Ted said: ""Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.""
Uncle Billy said: ""I have only one concern..."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""You do like girls, don't you?""
Ted said: ""Of course I like girls.""
Uncle Billy said: ""A lot? I mean, a whole lot?""
Ted said: ""As much as possible.""
Uncle Billy said: ""You're sure?"""
"Uncle Billy said: ""The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.""
Ted said: ""Seldom? No kidding?"""
"Ted said: ""Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?""
Uncle Billy said: ""Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.""
Ted said: ""I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""We don't allow TIPN, Ted.""
Ted said: ""Tipping?"""
"Uncle Billy said: ""There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?""
Ted said: ""Yeah.  Everything's cool."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.""
Ted said: ""Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.""
Uncle Billy said: ""They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that."""
"Ted said: ""Truth is, I'm a little nervous.""
Uncle Billy said: ""YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?""
Ted said: ""All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.""
Uncle Billy said: ""Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!""
Ted said: ""I do?""
Uncle Billy said: ""You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.""
Ted said: ""Me? The King of Coitus?""
Uncle Billy said: ""The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.""
Ted said: ""Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...""
Uncle Billy said: ""Why, look who's here."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""I told you you could do it.""
Ted said: ""I was like a different person tonight.""
Uncle Billy said: ""You were the new and improved you.""
Ted said: ""I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.""
Uncle Billy said: ""No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.""
Ted said: ""It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.""
Uncle Billy said: ""You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.""
Ted said: ""Really? You'd do that for me?""
Uncle Billy said: ""I've been very lazy for a long, long time.""
Ted said: ""You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.""
Uncle Billy said: ""I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.""
Ted said: ""My parents always say hard work builds character.""
Uncle Billy said: ""It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.""
Ted said: ""What kind of ideas?""
Uncle Billy said: ""Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of ""classic beauty.""""
Ted said: ""You think we should be more open minded?""
Uncle Billy said: ""The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.""
Ted said: ""In other words, our scope is too narrow.""
Uncle Billy said: ""At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.""
Ted said: ""That's perfect."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.""
Ted said: ""I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.""
Ted said: ""Really? So I'm doing OK?"""
"Ted said: ""My father must've been amazing.""
Uncle Billy said: ""He was in a league of his own."""
"Ted said: ""I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.""
Uncle Billy said: ""I can't wait to see the pictures.""
Ted said: ""It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?""
Ted said: ""Seriously? I'm doing all right?""
Uncle Billy said: ""You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this ""stuff"" spoil you."""
"Ted said: ""I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.""
Uncle Billy said: ""I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.""
Ted said: ""Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents."""
"Ted said: ""I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.""
Uncle Billy said: ""You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.""
Ted said: ""Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.""
Uncle Billy said: ""You're a great kid. Don't you forget it."""
"Ted said: ""Yes?""
Uncle Billy said: ""We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk."""
"Uncle Billy said: ""I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--""
Ted said: ""--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!"""
"Uncle Billy said: ""What are you doing?""
Ted said: ""My job. Back off, Benedict."""
"Ted said: ""Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.""
Uncle Billy said: ""All is fair in ""Heaven,"" Ted-baby.""
Ted said: ""That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.""
Uncle Billy said: ""Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes."""
"Zukerman said: ""In a hurry, are we?""
Ted said: ""I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?""
Zukerman said: ""Bad news.""
Ted said: ""People pay good money for that?""
Zukerman said: ""I'm just a messenger."""
"Ted said: ""Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.""
Zukerman said: ""It's about your parents."""
"Ted said: ""My parents? What do you mean?""
Zukerman said: ""I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.""
Ted said: ""You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.""
Zukerman said: ""Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents."""
"Zukerman said: ""How quaint.""
Ted said: ""It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading."""
"Zukerman said: ""Are you familiar with ""Heaven?""""
Ted said: ""I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.""
Zukerman said: ""Your fathered owned the entire ""Heaven"" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?"""
"Art said: ""So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?""
Sam said: ""I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie."""

Art said: ""Kelly Van Ryan...""
Sam said: ""... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...""
Art said: ""Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...""
Sam said: ""This is insane."""
"Art said: ""All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...""
Sam said: ""That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.""
Art said: ""The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one."""

"Barbara said: ""Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...""
Sam said: ""Eat a power bar."""
"Barbara said: ""Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?""
Sam said: ""Kelly.""
Barbara said: ""She's going to wash your Jeep?""
Sam said: ""Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause."""
"Sam said: ""You look pretty.""
Barbara said: ""Thanks."""
"Sam said: ""Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.""
Barbara said: ""And where might that be?""
Sam said: ""I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.""
Barbara said: ""I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.""
Sam said: ""I'd like that."""
"Ray said: ""How soon can we get something?""
Dave said: ""We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks."""
"Dave said: ""Merritt, Forensics.""
Ray said: ""The teeth doin' any talkin'?""
Dave said: ""Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...""
Ray said: ""What about the blood?""
Dave said: ""Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...""
Ray said: ""Second you get something on those teeth, I want it"""
"Ruby said: ""Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.""
Gloria said: ""What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?""
Ruby said: ""Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway."""
"Ruby said: ""You come all the way out here to watch Walter?""
Gloria said: ""I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.""
Ruby said: ""About Suzie?""
Gloria said: ""Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.""
Ruby said: ""He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades."""
"Ruby said: ""Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.""
Gloria said: ""She still work there?""
Ruby said: ""No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.""
Gloria said: ""Was there ever any kind of investigation..."""
"Ruby said: ""Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.""
Gloria said: ""And the child...""
Ruby said: ""She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...""
Gloria said: ""Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...""
Ruby said: ""Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him."""
"Gloria said: ""So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.""
Ruby said: ""And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece."""
"Ruby said: ""You okay?""
Gloria said: ""I'm fine.  Nice TV."""
"Gloria said: ""How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?""
Kelly said: ""I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.""
Gloria said: ""I know you do."""
"Kelly said: ""The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...""
Gloria said: ""Take your time.""
Kelly said: ""They were in me.  Both places... you know.""
Gloria said: ""I understand.""
Kelly said: ""He said something like, ""Do you want it dirty7"" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.""
Gloria said: ""Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?""
Kelly said: ""Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...""
Gloria said: ""That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?""
Kelly said: ""No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...""
Gloria said: ""He was large?"""
"Gloria said: ""Did you try to fight him?""
Kelly said: ""I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'""
Gloria said: ""Then what?""
Kelly said: ""He kept saying, ""Let it happen, let it happen.""  Then he just stopped.""
Gloria said: ""You mean he withdrew...""
Kelly said: ""Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.""
Gloria said: ""Try, Kelly.""
Kelly said: ""I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, ""Don't worry, I didn't come."" I can't forget that.  He said, ""No little girl can ever make me come."""""
"Sam said: ""If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.""
Gloria said: ""I'd like that."""
"Gloria said: ""And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?""
Sam said: ""Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab."""
"Gloria said: ""Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?""
Sam said: ""No.""
Gloria said: ""Weren't you a little worried about her...?""
Sam said: ""There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office."""
"Sam said: ""Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?""
Gloria said: ""Suzie Toller is missing."""
"Sam said: ""How long?""
Gloria said: ""She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.""
Sam said: ""Maybe she used another name.""
Gloria said: ""Ray thinks she was murdered."""
"Sam said: ""I don't know what to say...""
Gloria said: ""You could tell me where you were last night."""
"Sam said: ""Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.""
Gloria said: ""Suzie?"""
"Ray said: ""I've got that two o'clock in town.""
Gloria said: ""Back to the land of grownups."""
"Ray said: ""That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?""
Gloria said: ""All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here."""
"Ray said: ""It's our job, Gloria.""
Gloria said: ""Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary."""
"Gloria said: ""Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.""
Ray said: ""Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?"""
"Gloria said: ""We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.""
Ray said: ""You're telling me you believe the guy?""
Gloria said: ""All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid."""
"Gloria said: ""You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.""
Ray said: ""Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now."""
"Ray said: ""You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?""
Gloria said: ""The skinny brunette.""
Ray said: ""This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.""
Gloria said: ""You mean Camp Sixty-Nine."""
"Gloria said: ""That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.""
Ray said: ""It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?"""
"Ray said: ""You saw the news today?""
Gloria said: ""Lombardo's settlement?"""
"Ray said: ""Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.""
Gloria said: ""Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.""
Ray said: ""I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...""
Gloria said: ""Unless what?""
Ray said: ""Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday."""
"Ray said: ""They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.""
Gloria said: ""Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...""
Ray said: ""The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his."""
"Gloria said: ""So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...""
Ray said: ""Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck."""
"Gloria said: ""This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?""
Ray said: ""I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.""
Gloria said: ""Eliminate the competition.""
Ray said: ""You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp."""
"Gloria said: ""Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?""
Ray said: ""I net a guy in a bar."""
"Gloria said: ""Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.""
Ray said: ""What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did..."""
"Ray said: ""Guess I kind of lost it there.""
Gloria said: ""You could say that.""
Ray said: ""Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?"""
"Gloria said: ""We all have...""
Ray said: ""I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again."""
"Ray said: ""It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...""
Gloria said: ""Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere..."""
"Ray said: ""I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?""
Gloria said: ""You have someplace to be?"""
"Gloria said: ""If you want company...""
Ray said: ""Just check out the car."""
"Gloria said: ""Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.""
Ray said: ""Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.""
Gloria said: ""Where's the body?""
Ray said: ""The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake."""
"Gloria said: ""Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.""
Ray said: ""You don't think Sam could've put it there?"""
"Ray said: ""Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.""
Gloria said: ""We don't know that, Ray..."""
"Ray said: ""Will you do me one favor?""
Gloria said: ""Ray, you heard him...""
Ray said: ""What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?"""
"Ray said: ""Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...""
Gloria said: ""And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?""
Ray said: ""If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise."""
"Gloria said: ""I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.""
Ray said: ""Where's Lombardo?""
Gloria said: ""He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.""
Ray said: ""The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.""
Gloria said: ""It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track..."""
"Gloria said: ""That bothers you?""
Suzie said: ""Yeah, maybe, a little.""
Gloria said: ""Why is that?"""
"Suzie said: ""You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.""
Gloria said: ""We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?"""
"Suzie said: ""About a year ago.""
Gloria said: ""He dropped Jimmy off first?""
Suzie said: ""Yeah.""
Gloria said: ""And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?""
Suzie said: ""No.""
Gloria said: ""So you were alone.""
Suzie said: ""Yes.""
Gloria said: ""Did he come in with you?""
Suzie said: ""I guess."""
"Gloria said: ""At that point were you able to fight him off?""
Suzie said: ""No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go."""
"Suzie said: ""He did say something.""
Gloria said: ""What was that?""
Suzie said: ""He said, ""No little bitch can ever make me come."""""
"Hunter said: ""Why?""
Gloria said: ""I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't..."""
"Gloria said: ""That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...""
Hunter said: ""Where's this coming from?""
Gloria said: ""I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers."""
"Hunter said: ""I want a full-scale investigation.""
Gloria said: ""You know what that will mean for Lombardo.""
Hunter said: ""I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case."""
"Ray said: ""Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...""
Hunter said: ""The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay."""
"Ray said: ""Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.""
Hunter said: ""What about witnesses?""
Ray said: ""We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.""
Hunter said: ""And what do they say?"""
"Hunter said: ""Are you crazy, Ray?""
Ray said: ""You heard Kelly say ""Sam.""  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...""
Hunter said: ""Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...""
Ray said: ""I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money."""
"Hunter said: ""Oh, Ray... no...""
Ray said: ""You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead..."""
"Ray said: ""Kelly's next, Gloria.""
Hunter said: ""Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me."""
"Ray said: ""I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?""
Hunter said: ""Just tell us what happened.""
Ray said: ""I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights."""
"Hunter said: ""She bit you?""
Ray said: ""Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom."""
"Ray said: ""I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.""
Hunter said: ""You didn't cuff her?""
Ray said: ""She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest."""
"Ray said: ""The teeth, were they...""
Hunter said: ""Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass."""
"Hunter said: ""You guess?  Did he or didn't he?""
Suzie said: ""Yeah... okay... he did""
Hunter said: ""And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...""
Suzie said: ""I wanna go home now."""
"Hunter said: ""What did you do then?""
Suzie said: ""Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...""
Hunter said: ""Suzie!  Did this man rape you?""
Suzie said: ""Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?"""
"Suzie said: ""He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.""
Hunter said: ""I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?""
Suzie said: ""Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp."""
"Hunter said: ""Ms. Toller?""
Suzie said: ""I said he did.""
Hunter said: ""Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?"""
"Suzie said: ""This wasn't my idea.""
Hunter said: ""I'm sorry?"""
"Suzie said: ""He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.""
Hunter said: ""Your Honor... Please..."""
"Sam said: ""Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?""
Jimmy said: ""No!"""
"Sam said: ""Thank you, Jimmy.""
Jimmy said: ""Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate."""
"Jimmy said: ""You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...""
Sam said: ""Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be."""
"Sam said: ""What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?""
Jimmy said: ""What?""
Sam said: ""A ride.  You want one?""
Jimmy said: ""Yeah.  But I got my bike."""
"Jimmy said: ""It's those rocks, up there.""
Ray said: ""You and Suzie used to come out here together?""
Jimmy said: ""Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?""
Ray said: ""Lombardo ever come out here?"""
"Ray said: ""I say something funny?""
Jimmy said: ""No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...""
Ray said: ""Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...""
Jimmy said: ""Yeah, but..."""
"Kelly said: ""Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.""
Suzie said: ""Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...""
Kelly said: ""Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.""
Suzie said: ""Man, I wanna smoke a joint."""
"Kelly said: ""I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?""
Suzie said: ""I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.""
Kelly said: ""You can trust me."""
"Suzie said: ""You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?""
Kelly said: ""Oh, for Christ's sake.""
Suzie said: ""You are.""
Kelly said: ""Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp..."""
"Kelly said: ""Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?""
Suzie said: ""What brain?"""
"Suzie said: ""What are you looking at?""
Kelly said: ""Nothing."""
"Suzie said: ""I thought we were goin' to a movie.""
Kelly said: ""I think we just need to get wasted."""
"Suzie said: ""I wanna live at the beach someday.""
Kelly said: ""Shit."""
"Kelly said: ""Is there some reason why you're here?""
Ray said: ""Curiosity, I guess.""
Kelly said: ""About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?"""
"Kelly said: ""Excuse me?""
Ray said: ""You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?"""
"Ray said: ""The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.""
Kelly said: ""You're out of your mind.""
Ray said: ""I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?"""
"Ray said: ""Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.""
Kelly said: ""Police -- God -- get a life."""
"Kelly said: ""Get off my property.""
Ray said: ""I'm not on your property!"""
"Sandra said: ""Is that Sam Lombardo?""
Kelly said: ""Hi, Mon.""
Sandra said: ""Sam!  Hi!"""
"Kelly said: ""Which one of your ""bodyguards"" is that?""
Sandra said: ""Whichever one I want."""
"Sandra said: ""Okay, what's the matter?""
Kelly said: ""You notice my new jumper?"""
"Kelly said: ""My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.""
Sandra said: ""I would hardly say you look like trash.""
Kelly said: ""No thanks to you."""
"Sandra said: ""Kelly.  What is it?""
Kelly said: ""I miss Dad.""
Sandra said: ""Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...""
Kelly said: ""No you don't.""
Sandra said: ""He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married."""
"Sandra said: ""What?""
Kelly said: ""I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo."""
"Sandra said: ""He... Sam Lombardo?""
Kelly said: ""Yes.  God, Mom..."""
"Kelly said: ""You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...""
Sandra said: ""I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.""
Kelly said: ""Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.""
Sandra said: ""Where, the mall?""
Kelly said: ""A friend of mine bought a boat."""
"Sam said: ""Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.""
Kelly said: ""Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?"""
"Kelly said: ""Don't forget the car wash.""
Sam said: ""I won't."""
"Kelly said: ""Look, he forgot.  I knew it.""
Sam said: ""No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving."""
"Kelly said: ""Where's the hose?  We can set up.""
Sam said: ""In back of the garage."""
"Sam said: ""So, where you off to now?""
Kelly said: ""Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.""
Sam said: ""Jeez, that thing... Can't you...""
Kelly said: ""Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo."""
"Sam said: ""All right.  I'll have to look for it.""
Kelly said: ""Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket."""
"Sam said: ""Kelly...""
Kelly said: ""Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...""
Sam said: ""Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning."""
"Sam said: ""Jesus Christ, what are you doing?""
Kelly said: ""So you got my mom's money."""
"Kelly said: ""How much?""
Sam said: ""About six and a half million dollars."""
"Sam said: ""God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.""
Kelly said: ""Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom."""
"Sam said: ""From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...""
Kelly said: ""Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party."""
"Sam said: ""The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...""
Kelly said: ""Do it to ourselves?""
Sam said: ""We have to stick with the plan.""
Kelly said: ""Stick?"""
"Sam said: ""Kelly.  Is Suzie there?""
Kelly said: ""Yes.""
Sam said: ""Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?""
Kelly said: ""Why can't you come...""
Sam said: ""No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...""
Kelly said: ""You know what it takes.""
Sam said: ""Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?"""
"Kelly said: ""I'm here.""
Sam said: ""Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds."""
"Sam said: ""I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...""
Kelly said: ""There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb..."""
"Kelly said: ""Hello?""
Sam said: ""Hello.""
Kelly said: ""God, I've been calling you."""
"Kelly said: ""I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.""
Sam said: ""Duquette.  Forget him...""
Kelly said: ""I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...""
Sam said: ""Yeah, he got her busted for possession...""
Kelly said: ""I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...""
Sam said: ""And you believe her?""
Kelly said: ""I don't know.  I want to see you...""
Sam said: ""Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.""
Kelly said: ""But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber..."""
"Sam said: ""So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.""
Kelly said: ""Okay.  I love you too."""
"Kelly said: ""That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.""
Sam said: ""That's not your line.""
Kelly said: ""Say you love me.""
Sam said: ""I love you.  Now give me the line.""
Kelly said: ""No little girl can ever make me come."""
"Kelly said: ""I'm running away.""
Sam said: ""You think that's wise?""
Kelly said: ""Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys."""
"Ken said: ""But check this...""
Sam said: ""Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here."""
"Sam said: ""Good thinking.""
Ken said: ""You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...""
Sam said: ""Forget it.""
Ken said: ""Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.""
Sam said: ""I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?"""
"Sam said: ""Can't you take that stupid thing off?""
Ken said: ""Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes."""
"Ken said: ""You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.""
Sam said: ""What's that supposed to mean?""
Ken said: ""For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless."""
"Sam said: ""Nellie Gail Ranch...""
Ken said: ""Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.""
Sam said: ""There's nothing for them to get.""
Ken said: ""Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...""
Sam said: ""I just want my life back...""
Ken said: ""Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement."""
"Ken said: ""Come on, let loose!""
Sam said: ""I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.""
Ken said: ""You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.""
Sam said: ""Just like that?""
Ken said: ""Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro."""
"Ray said: ""You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.""
Sandra said: ""That's right."""
"Sandra said: ""Who is it?""
Ray said: ""Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now."""
"Ray said: ""Where is she?""
Sandra said: ""Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?""
Ray said: ""I'm placing your daughter under arrest.""
Sandra said: ""You can't...""
Ray said: ""Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way."""
"Ray said: ""Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.""
Suzie said: ""I did.  At Blue Balls."""
"Suzie said: ""It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.""
Ray said: ""So Suzie, you called us, remember?"""
"Ray said: ""No.""
Suzie said: ""Will they?""
Ray said: ""It doesn't look like it.""
Suzie said: ""Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?"""
"Ray said: ""You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.""
Suzie said: ""You got something against cigarettes?"""
"Ray said: ""Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...""
Suzie said: ""That's cop bullshit.""
Ray said: ""Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.""
Suzie said: ""About what?""
Ray said: ""Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.""
Suzie said: ""Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?""
Ray said: ""You, Kelly, Sam.""
Suzie said: ""I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now..."""
"Ray said: ""Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?""
Suzie said: ""I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...""
Ray said: ""Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit..."""
"Suzie said: ""Get away from me.""
Ray said: ""Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?""
Suzie said: ""Shut up."""
"Suzie said: ""Davy.""
Ray said: ""That's right.  That was his name."""
"Ray said: ""You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...""
Suzie said: ""Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water."""
"Ray said: ""Sam, for godsake.""
Suzie said: ""Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?"""
"Ray said: ""Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.""
Sam said: ""Story's the same, Detective..."""
"Sam said: ""I had to go look for this coupon.""
Ray said: ""The one you bought at school.""
Sam said: ""Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.""
Ray said: ""In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.""
Sam said: ""Yes.""
Ray said: ""And she wanted to talk.""
Sam said: ""Yes.""
Ray said: ""But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.""
Sam said: ""I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.""
Ray said: ""And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.""
Sam said: ""Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office."""
"Ray said: ""But she ran away.""
Sam said: ""That's right."""
"Ray said: ""But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?""
Sam said: ""It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...""
Ray said: ""With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra..."""
"Sam said: ""Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.""
Ray said: ""Sit down, Lombardo."""
"Sam said: ""Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?""
Ray said: ""The bitch shot me, is what happened."""
"Ray said: ""Hey, what did you want me to do, die?""
Sam said: ""Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake."""
"Ray said: ""Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.""
Sam said: ""Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises."""
"Ray said: ""You mean this thing?""
Sam said: ""Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.""
Ray said: ""I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?""
Sam said: ""Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.""
Ray said: ""Yeah, or get me drowned."""
"Sam said: ""Jesus, man... You okay?""
Ray said: ""That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...""
Sam said: ""Come off it, man... It was an accident."""
"Suzie said: ""How much is about six and a half million divided by three?""
Sam said: ""Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change."""
"Suzie said: ""Sam...""
Sam said: ""Put Kelly on too."""
"Suzie said: ""But I..""
Sam said: ""Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?"""
"Suzie said: ""Yeah, right.""
Sam said: ""Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us."""
"Sam said: ""I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.""
Suzie said: ""Are you mad at me?""
Sam said: ""No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight."""
"Sam said: ""That was about as grim as it gets.""
Suzie said: ""The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.""
Sam said: ""But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...""
Suzie said: ""But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends."""
"Suzie said: ""What?""
Sam said: ""That was the same thing Ray said."""
"Sam said: ""What's wrong?""
Suzie said: ""Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive."""
"Suzie said: ""Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.""
Sam said: ""Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.""
Suzie said: ""Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend."""
"Suzie said: ""I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?""
Sam said: ""We?""
Suzie said: ""Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already."""
"Sam said: ""How...""
Suzie said: ""Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?""
Sam said: ""I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them."""
"Sandra said: ""What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?""
Sam said: ""Hi, Sandy.""
Sandra said: ""Why don't you come in, have a drink?""
Sam said: ""Can't.  Got a passenger."""
"Sam said: ""I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.""
Sandra said: ""I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...""
Sam said: ""Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.""
Sandra said: ""What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...""
Sam said: ""Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time."""
"Sam said: ""Sandy... What's up?""
Sandra said: ""Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?""
Sam said: ""No.""
Sandra said: ""Shit. Here we go again.""
Sam said: ""Didn't you see her this morning?""
Sandra said: ""To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday."""
"Sandra said: ""Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?""
Sam said: ""So maybe I'm a one-woman man."""
"Sandra said: ""Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.""
Sam said: ""Goodbye, Sandra."""
"Artemus said: ""J. S. Bach.""
Jim said: ""Jim West.""
Artemus said: ""Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.""
Jim said: ""I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?""
Artemus said: ""Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.""
Jim said: ""Funny.  So am I.""
Artemus said: ""Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.""
Jim said: ""Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.""
Artemus said: ""Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk..."""
"Jim said: ""Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?""
Artemus said: ""Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors."""
"Jim said: ""You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.""
Artemus said: ""If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco."""
"Jim said: ""But don't pull that again.""
Artemus said: ""Wouldn't dream of it."""
"Artemus said: ""Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...""
Jim said: ""Put them all together and what do we have?""
Artemus said: ""A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.""
Jim said: ""Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?""
Artemus said: """"Ay, there's the rub.""  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy."""
"Artemus said: ""Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...""
Jim said: ""Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.""
Artemus said: """"Gadget guy?""  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science."""
"Artemus said: ""Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.""
Jim said: ""You need that real often?""
Artemus said: ""Always hoping.  Or this...""
Jim said: ""No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.""
Artemus said: ""Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!""
Jim said: ""All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.""
Artemus said: ""Try what?"""
"Jim said: ""Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.""
Artemus said: ""Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots..."""
"Jim said: ""That should put us ahead of the criminals.""
Artemus said: ""I'll work on it."""
"Artemus said: ""Aha!""
Jim said: ""Aha?""
Artemus said: ""Yes, aha.  A brass screw.""
Jim said: ""Is this leading somewhere?""
Artemus said: ""Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.""
Jim said: ""Starting with a screw?""
Artemus said: ""Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...""
Jim said: ""What about the explosive?"""
"Artemus said: ""Limestone quarry?""
Jim said: ""Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.""
Artemus said: ""Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women."""
"Artemus said: ""Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.""
Jim said: ""Prepare what?""
Artemus said: ""My disguise.  And here..."""
"Artemus said: ""Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.""
Jim said: ""Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.""
Artemus said: ""Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet."""
"Jim said: ""That's a lot of butler.""
Artemus said: ""Quite.  Come, let's mingle.""
Jim said: ""Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey."""
"Jim said: ""Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.""
Artemus said: ""Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.""
Jim said: ""All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...""
Artemus said: ""Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?"""
"Artemus said: ""You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.""
Jim said: ""Almost?""
Artemus said: ""Yes.  Now, observe...."""
"Jim said: ""You feeling all right?""
Artemus said: ""Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it."""
"Artemus said: ""Now, what was that?""
Jim said: ""You're either having a seizure or you just said ""hello.""""
Artemus said: ""Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it."""
"Artemus said: ""What was all that back there?""
Jim said: ""All what?""
Artemus said: ""All that jumping and kicking.""
Jim said: ""That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested."""
"Artemus said: ""Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.""
Jim said: ""And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it."""
"Artemus said: ""Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.""
Jim said: ""I'm going to hit you."""
"Jim said: ""Never seen a gun fire so fast!""
Artemus said: ""It's a repeating steam cannon!"""
"Jim said: ""At least I tried something.""
Artemus said: ""Hey, I tried the board."""
"Artemus said: ""Damn it, this is ridiculous.""
Jim said: ""At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.""
Artemus said: ""That's right... That's good."""
"Artemus said: ""Jim, are you all right?""
Jim said: ""No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.""
Artemus said: ""Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works."""
"Artemus said: ""If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?""
Jim said: ""What way is that?""
Artemus said: ""So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.""
Jim said: """"Spontaneous.""  I like that.  Most people say something like ""hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch.""""
Artemus said: ""Well... that, too.""
Jim said: ""Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly."""
"Artemus said: ""So... what happened?""
Jim said: ""Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.""
Artemus said: ""Uh... how long ago was this?""
Jim said: ""I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later."""
"Jim said: ""You might have mentioned you had that.""
Artemus said: ""I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun."""
"Artemus said: ""Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.""
Jim said: ""I find most criminals slip up somewhere..."""
"Artemus said: ""They're so precious when they're asleep.""
Jim said: ""You really enjoy yourself, don't you?"""
"Artemus said: ""Can you fill me in here?""
Jim said: ""Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.""
Artemus said: ""Thank you.""
Jim said: ""Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.""
Artemus said: ""You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless."""
"Artemus said: ""Know what this is?""
Jim said: ""Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.""
Artemus said: ""A cylinder recorder.  My own design."""
"Jim said: ""This is good.""
Artemus said: ""Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!"""
"Artemus said: ""Oh, damn!  That's it.""
Jim said: ""It's better than nothing.""
Artemus said: ""It is?""
Jim said: ""He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard."""
"Jim said: ""No record of him.""
Artemus said: ""You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen."""
"Artemus said: ""What's this?""
Jim said: ""Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.""
Artemus said: ""Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours."""
"Artemus said: ""Willard...""
Jim said: ""It's not a guy...""
Artemus said: ""It's a town!"""
"Artemus said: ""Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was ""damnably hot.""""
Jim said: ""That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?"""
"Jim said: ""Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.""
Artemus said: ""Relax.  We're almost there.""
Jim said: ""We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!"""
"Jim said: ""What is that?""
Artemus said: ""This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.""
Jim said: ""And people are actually fooled by that?""
Artemus said: ""My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear."""
"Jim said: ""Not again.""
Artemus said: ""I adjusted it."""
"Jim said: ""So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?""
Artemus said: ""You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?"""
"Jim said: ""When we find him, he is mine.""
Artemus said: ""Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty."""
"Artemus said: ""What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?""
Jim said: ""Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards..."""
"Artemus said: ""Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.""
Jim said: ""Oh, thank you.""
Artemus said: ""My pleasure."""
"Jim said: ""Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.""
Artemus said: ""What?  President Grant is...!""
Jim said: ""I know!  I know!""
Artemus said: ""I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!""
Jim said: ""We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.""
Artemus said: ""I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?""
Jim said: ""There's only seventy-eight.""
Artemus said: ""Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!"""
"Artemus said: ""It was in your book.""
Jim said: ""Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance."""
"Jim said: ""Are those just button buttons or...?""
Artemus said: ""Of course not."""
"Artemus said: ""My hat is off to you, sir.""
Jim said: ""Thank you."""
"Artemus said: ""God in heaven, what is that?!""
Jim said: ""That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!"""
"Artemus said: ""My God!  He's so excessive!""
Jim said: ""Where have you been?"""
"Jim said: ""Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!""
Artemus said: ""Oh, I see, an easy plan!"""
"Artemus said: ""The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!""
Jim said: ""He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!""
Artemus said: ""All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.""
Jim said: ""In the next two minutes?"""
"Jim said: ""Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.""
Artemus said: ""What is this?  A whole new train?""
Jim said: ""Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?"""
"Jim said: ""Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.""
Artemus said: ""I'm sure we will."""
"Artemus said: ""Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...""
Pemberton said: ""Yes, me!""
Artemus said: ""You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel."""
"Artemus said: ""You didn't tell us you had this on!""
Pemberton said: ""My Lord, he was telling the truth!"""
"Pemberton said: ""He calls it the Tarantula.""
Artemus said: ""But it only has six legs."""
"Pemberton said: ""He's not giving up?""
Artemus said: ""Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid..."""

Pemberton said: ""Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!"""
"Miguelito said: ""A new friend?""
Cassandra said: ""We'll see."""
"Miguelito said: ""Anyone?""
Cassandra said: ""Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.""
Miguelito said: ""Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please..."""
"Miguelito said: ""I could get used to this, looking down on people.""
Cassandra said: ""They don't even realize they should be frightened.""
Miguelito said: ""Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs."""
"Jim said: ""My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.""
Cassandra said: ""I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.""
Jim said: ""You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.""
Cassandra said: ""I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before."""
"Jim said: ""Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.""
Cassandra said: ""Really?""
Jim said: ""Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.""
Cassandra said: ""My... the wild west."""
"Cassandra said: ""Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.""
Jim said: ""Your guests, ma'am?""
Cassandra said: ""Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know."""
"Cassandra said: ""Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.""
Jim said: ""Well, I owe you one, don't I?""
Cassandra said: ""You most certainly do."""
"Cassandra said: ""You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.""
Jim said: ""I don't like to lose, either."""
"Cassandra said: ""Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?""
Jim said: ""You tell me.""
Cassandra said: ""I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.""
Jim said: ""Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.""
Cassandra said: ""Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?""
Jim said: ""I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too."""
"Jim said: ""Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.""
Cassandra said: ""Would that include me?""
Jim said: ""Oh, I would hope not."""
"Cassandra said: ""You've... done... this... before.""
Jim said: ""I've had some practice."""
"Cassandra said: ""She's perfectly safe.""
Jim said: ""Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?"""
"Cassandra said: ""My.  It's gotten longer.""
Jim said: ""You bring the best out in a man.""
Cassandra said: ""I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case."""
"Jim said: ""You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.""
Cassandra said: ""Fine, I'll stop."""
"Jim said: ""Look, I'm Captain James West...""
Doyle said: ""Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here."""
"Doyle said: ""Your private train, sir.""
Jim said: ""Private train?""
Doyle said: ""That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well."""
"Doyle said: ""Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.""
Jim said: ""My friend?"""
"Doyle said: ""Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?""
Jim said: ""I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?"""
"Grant said: ""Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?""
Richards said: ""Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case..."""
"Grant said: ""Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.""
Richards said: ""Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...""
Grant said: ""French?""
Richards said: ""Yes sir.""
Grant said: ""French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!"""
"Richards said: ""Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...""
Grant said: ""A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?"""
"Jim said: ""Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.""
Grant said: ""That'll be all, boys."""
"Jim said: ""Good work.  Really.""
Grant said: ""This is Colonel Richards.""
Jim said: ""Nice to finally meet you, sir."""
"Jim said: ""But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.""
Grant said: ""Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced."""
"Grant said: ""We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!""
Jim said: ""Nicely said, sir.""
Grant said: ""Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking."""
"Grant said: ""Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...""
Jim said: ""And?""
Grant said: ""And now the job's yours."""
"Jim said: ""... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?""
Grant said: ""On my way to Denver..."""
"Jim said: ""Where'd he say he was going to do this?""
Grant said: ""He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer."""
"Jim said: ""I admire a man with a sense of humor.""
Miguelito said: ""When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?"""
"Jim said: ""I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.""
Miguelito said: ""Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have."""
"Miguelito said: ""Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.""
Jim said: ""No, sir... just a businessman.""
Miguelito said: ""Really?  Must be a dangerous business.""
Jim said: ""I deal with some tough customers."""
"Miguelito said: ""Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.""
Jim said: ""How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?"""
"Jim said: ""Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.""
Miguelito said: ""Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?"""
"Miguelito said: ""... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!""
Jim said: ""Dr. Loveless?"""
"Jim said: ""You're not that big.""
Miguelito said: ""Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant."""
"Miguelito said: ""Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.""
Jim said: ""He had a pressing engagement.""
Miguelito said: ""Philistine."""
"Jim said: ""You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.""
Miguelito said: ""Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!""
Jim said: ""Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?"""
"Jim said: ""The U.S. is my jurisdiction.""
Miguelito said: ""Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!"""
"Miguelito said: ""These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.""
Jim said: ""That would be... the Mexican War?""
Miguelito said: ""Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!"""
"Miguelito said: ""I've even printed my own currency.""
Jim said: """"Emperor Miguelito...?""""
Miguelito said: ""The first.""
Jim said: ""Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?""
Miguelito said: ""Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!""
Jim said: ""So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?"""
"Jim said: ""Easy now.""
Miguelito said: ""Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?"""
"Jim said: ""Dr. Pemberton?""
Pemberton said: ""Yes!"""
"Jim said: ""Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.""
Pemberton said: ""Who were they?  What do they want with me?""
Jim said: ""We'll explain on the way."""
"Pemberton said: ""I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the ""rare and unparalleled opportunity"" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.""
Jim said: ""Who was this partner of his?""
Pemberton said: ""A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.""
Jim said: ""A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch."""
"Jim said: ""Are you all right?""
Pemberton said: ""For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now."""
"Pemberton said: ""He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?""
Jim said: ""He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out."""
"Jim said: ""This is something.""
Pemberton said: ""It's a smelting retort."""
"Jim said: ""Now it's a bomb.""
Pemberton said: ""It is?"""
"Jim said: ""I beg your pardon?""
Pemberton said: ""You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this."""
"Jim said: ""Well?""
Walters said: ""They're coming.""
Jim said: ""When are they coming?""
Walters said: ""They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?""
Jim said: ""In an hour they're gone!"""

Jim said: ""You're not going to use it, are you?""
Walters said: ""Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...""
Jim said: ""Right."""

Airk said: ""Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!""
Madmartigan said: ""Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you."""
"Madmartigan said: ""You left me to die, friend.""
Airk said: ""You managed alright.""
Madmartigan said: ""Is this what's left of your army?"""

Madmartigan said: ""They're not after me.  They want the baby."""
"Airk said: ""You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?""
Madmartigan said: ""Then come with us."""

Cherlindrea said: ""She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth."""

Willow said: ""You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.""
Cherlindrea said: ""You are very important, Willow.""
Willow said: ""No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!"""

Willow said: ""My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin."""
"High Aldwin said: ""Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.""
Willow said: ""If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?""
High Aldwin said: ""You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.""
Willow said: ""I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!""
High Aldwin said: ""Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition."""
"High Aldwin said: ""Go in the direction the bird is flying.""
Willow said: ""Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!""
High Aldwin said: ""Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow..."""

Raziel said: ""We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy."""
"Raziel said: ""Again:  what is the magician's weapon?""
Willow said: ""His will.""
Raziel said: ""Now use it."""
"Willow said: ""I just wanted to test it first.""
Raziel said: ""No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow."""
"Raziel said: ""Tir Asleen.""
Willow said: ""There's nobody here."""
"Willow said: ""How??""
Raziel said: ""Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!"""
"Willow said: ""I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!""
Raziel said: ""More!  More!"""
"Willow said: ""Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!""
Raziel said: ""You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me."""
"Raziel said: ""Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!""
Willow said: ""Why?""
Raziel said: ""Just do it!"""
"Willow said: ""I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!""
Raziel said: ""No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!""
Willow said: ""She's too powerful, Raziel"""
"Raziel said: ""Time is running out.""
Willow said: ""Surrender!!"""
"Raziel said: ""Patience, Willow.""
Willow said: ""Courage, Willow."""
"Teemo said: ""Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.""
Rool said: ""Somebody has to do it."""
"Teemo said: ""Watch this.  Right between the eyes.""
Rool said: ""He never misses."""
"Teemo said: ""I'm not going in there.""
Rool said: ""Me neither!"""
"Teemo said: ""Are you sure?""
Rool said: ""Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!"""
"Teemo said: ""We gotta follow them.""
Rool said: ""Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home."""
"Teemo said: ""Get back here, Rool!""
Rool said: ""Ouch!  Let go of me!"""
"Willow said: ""If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.""
Sorsha said: ""Shut up."""
"Willow said: ""She needs to be changed.""
Sorsha said: ""I changed her already!"""
"Willow said: ""She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.""
Sorsha said: ""Who is that horrible friend of yours?""
Willow said: ""Madmartigan.""
Sorsha said: ""Who is he?""
Willow said: ""I don't know much about him."""
"Willow said: ""She's hungry.""
Sorsha said: ""I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.""
Willow said: ""Here.  Hold her."""
"Teemo said: ""We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.""
Willow said: ""Queen Cherlindrea?""
Teemo said: ""She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.""
Willow said: ""Who??""
Teemo said: ""You're the guardian, aren't you?"""
"Willow said: ""I'm getting her out of there!""
Teemo said: ""No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!"""
"Willow said: ""Ohhh, I hate this.""
Teemo said: ""Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.""
Willow said: ""Why not?"""
"Willow said: ""This is not going well.""
Teemo said: ""Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do."""
"Teemo said: ""Talk!  Say something!""
Willow said: ""I can't see anything--she's too bright!"""
"Teemo said: ""Hey, careful there!""
Willow said: ""How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin."""
"Teemo said: ""Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.""
Willow said: ""How are we going to get out there?"""
"Willow said: ""We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.""
Teemo said: ""The sorceress."""
"Teemo said: ""Obviously.""
Willow said: ""Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go."""
"Willow said: ""This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.""
Teemo said: ""Queen Bavmorda transformed her."""
"Book said: ""Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?""
Eli said: ""Maybe milking.""
Book said: ""Milking?""
Eli said: ""Cows. You know, cows?""
Book said: ""I've seen pictures.""
Eli said: ""Good, you start tomorrow."""
"Eli said: ""Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?""
Book said: ""Not one this big."""
"Eli said: ""Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?""
Book said: ""Guess I'm not used to so much.""
Eli said: ""Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite."""
"Elaine said: ""How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company""
Book said: ""Sorry. It's important."""
"Book said: ""Where's Timmy and Buck?""
Elaine said: ""Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?""
Book said: ""You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?""
Elaine said: ""That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.""
Book said: ""Oh sure, Fred."""
"Elaine said: ""Who are these orphans, anyway?""
Book said: ""They're Amish."""
"Book said: ""Put my car in the garage and close the door.""
Elaine said: ""John, I don't understand any of this.""
Book said: ""You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.""
Elaine said: ""John, why?...""
Book said: ""Just do it!"""
"Hochstetler said: ""Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?""
Book said: ""I thought I was the English.""
Hochstetler said: ""English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain."""
"Hochstetler said: ""I came to see Rachel Lapp.""
Book said: ""Try the house."""
"Hochstetler said: ""Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.""
Book said: ""It's been a while.""
Hochstetler said: ""No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter."""
"Hochstetler said: ""Your hole is healed, then?""
Book said: ""Pretty much."""
"Hochstetler said: ""Nail it!""
Book said: ""Yes, sir."""
"Hochstetler said: ""Everything is all right, John.""
Book said: ""Pick up the hat."""
"Samuel said: ""I saw him.""
Book said: ""Who'd you see?"""
"Book said: ""Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?""
Samuel said: ""No... I saw the man who killed him."""
"Samuel said: ""He was... like him.""
Book said: ""Black... I understand. What else,Sam?"""
"Book said: ""You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?""
Samuel said: ""No pistol. Ever.""
Book said: ""Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.""
Samuel said: ""Okay, Mr. Book."""
"Samuel said: ""That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.""
Book said: ""You don't say."""
"Book said: ""Hey, Sam...""
Samuel said: ""...I want to say a thing.""
Book said: ""What's that, Sam?"""
"Samuel said: ""Is it them?""
Book said: ""It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.""
Samuel said: ""Are they going to kill you?""
Book said: ""Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!""
Samuel said: ""What are you going to do?""
Book said: ""I'll be all right. You just do as I say."""
"Samuel said: ""Don't let them hurt you.""
Book said: ""I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!"""
"Samuel said: ""Are you really ever coming back?""
Book said: ""Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.""
Samuel said: ""Have you got your gun on now?""
Book said: ""Sure have, Sam."""
"Schaeffer said: ""How reliable is this kid?""
Book said: ""Oh, he's good.""
Schaeffer said: ""Amish.""
Book said: ""Yeah.""
Schaeffer said: ""What have you got?""
Book said: ""Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.""
Schaeffer said: ""So one of them got to him.""
Book said: ""Maybe.""
Schaeffer said: ""You know who?""
Book said: ""Maybe.""
Schaeffer said: ""You're still convinced there's a link to the department?""
Book said: ""If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.""
Schaeffer said: ""That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.""
Book said: ""The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.""
Schaeffer said: ""When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.""
Schaeffer said: ""Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.""
Book said: ""What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.""
Schaeffer said: ""Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife."""
"Book said: ""Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.""
Schaeffer said: ""I hope you don't have any doubts about that.""
Book said: ""If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.""
Schaeffer said: ""Who else knows?""
Book said: ""Just us.""
Schaeffer said: ""Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up""
Book said: ""More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.""
Schaeffer said: ""Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you."""
"Schaeffer said: ""What's your first move?""
Book said: ""A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days."""
"Schaeffer said: ""Who else knows?""
Book said: ""Just us."""
"Book said: ""You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.""
Schaeffer said: ""How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.""
Book said: ""I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.""
Schaeffer said: ""Johnny ""
Book said: ""You might want to pass it along to Mac.""
Schaeffer said: ""Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in ""
Book said: ""I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you."""
"Book said: ""You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.""
Schaeffer said: ""Don't try me, Johnny!"""
"Book said: ""It's all over, Paul.""
Schaeffer said: ""Move! Or you die right here!"""
"Book said: ""I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?""
Rachel said: ""Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.""
Book said: ""There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there."""
"Rachel said: ""Where are you taking us?""
Book said: ""We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.""
Rachel said: ""You have no right to keep us here.""
Book said: ""Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.""
Rachel said: ""You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!""
Book said: ""Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.""
Rachel said: ""It's not a joke."""
"Book said: ""What was that?""
Rachel said: ""He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you."""
"Book said: ""Now what's the problem?""
Rachel said: ""The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people."""
"Book said: ""Whacking?""
Rachel said: ""Yes. And I also want to leave this city.""
Book said: ""Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.""
Rachel said: ""We do not go into your courts.""
Book said: ""People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail."""
"Book said: ""Look, I'm genuinely sorry...""
Rachel said: ""No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.""
Book said: ""They kid a lot.""
Rachel said: ""I would not be too sure."""
"Rachel said: ""But not a good tired.""
Book said: ""What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired."""
"Rachel said: ""Your sister said you don't have a family?""
Book said: ""No.""
Rachel said: ""She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility."""
"Book said: ""Oh? Anything else?""
Rachel said: ""Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows."""
"Rachel said: ""Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?""
Book said: ""Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved."""
"Rachel said: ""But why would they murder...""
Book said: ""Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.""
Rachel said: ""I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.""
Book said: ""You'll be safe. You don't have to worry."""
"Rachel said: ""Where are you taking us now?""
Book said: ""Home.""
Rachel said: ""You couldn't wait until morning?"""
"Rachel said: ""You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.""
Book said: ""I was wrong."""
"Rachel said: ""Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.""
Book said: ""I can't.""
Rachel said: ""What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?"""
"Rachel said: ""But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?""
Book said: ""No, no doctor...""
Rachel said: ""But why?""
Book said: ""Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.""
Rachel said: ""But """
"Book said: ""Who are they?""
Rachel said: ""The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.""
Book said: ""Can I have something to drink?"""
"Book said: ""Does anybody know I'm here?""
Rachel said: ""Only the elders.""
Book said: ""How long?""
Rachel said: ""What?""
Book said: ""How long have I been here?""
Rachel said: ""Two days.""
Book said: ""Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.""
Rachel said: ""But you can't."""
"Book said: ""Tell him his tea stinks.""
Rachel said: ""You tell him. When you're able."""
"Rachel said: ""John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.""
Book said: ""Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -""
Rachel said: ""It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel."""
"Rachel said: ""Enjoying your reading?""
Book said: ""Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?""
Rachel said: ""Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these."""
"Book said: ""Your husband's?""
Rachel said: ""Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers."""
"Rachel said: ""I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.""
Book said: ""Something wrong with buttons?""
Rachel said: ""Buttons are Hochmut.""
Book said: ""Hochmut?""
Rachel said: ""Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.""
Book said: ""Anything against zippers?""
Rachel said: ""You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.""
Book said: ""Quaint? Can't imagine why."""
"Book said: ""Where's the nearest telephone?""
Rachel said: ""Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.""
Book said: ""No. I'd want a public phone."""
"Rachel said: ""Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.""
Book said: ""I'm going this morning.""
Rachel said: ""But Stoltzfus said...""
Book said: ""I know what he said.""
Rachel said: ""You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry."""
"Book said: ""The... bullets?""
Rachel said: ""Oh. The bullets."""
"Rachel said: ""Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.""
Book said: ""Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?""
Rachel said: ""We had some lemonade and he left.""
Book said: ""A real fireball."""
"Rachel said: ""You know carpentry?""
Book said: ""I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.""
Rachel said: ""What else can you do?""
Book said: ""I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.""
Rachel said: ""Whacking is not of much use on a farm.""
Book said: ""Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.""
Rachel said: ""I'm sorry. I'm sure it is."""
"Book said: ""Sure.""
Rachel said: ""But... You may not be well enough.""
Book said: ""I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea."""
"Rachel said: ""When will you be going?""
Book said: ""Not long... A few days."""
"Book said: ""Won him over just like that.""
Rachel said: ""I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's."""
"Rachel said: ""You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.""
Book said: ""I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun."""
"Rachel said: ""There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.""
Book said: ""There was.""
Rachel said: ""There was a time when I would have welcomed it.""
Book said: ""I know.""
Rachel said: ""I was being foolish?""
Book said: ""No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.""
Rachel said: ""You're so sure of that?""
Book said: ""Aren't you? After today?""
Rachel said: ""I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!""
Book said: ""Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.""
Rachel said: ""There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!""
Book said: ""Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!""
Rachel said: ""What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!""
Book said: ""That's your way, not mine.""
Rachel said: ""That's God's way!""
Book said: ""Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!"""
"Rachel said: ""I want you to take this... to remember by.""
Book said: ""Where's my baggy pants?""
Rachel said: ""Here. Whenever you want them."""
"Book said: ""Anybody know about this?""
Carter said: ""I didn't even know about it.""
Book said: ""Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?"""
"Carter said: ""I got there late, John.""
Book said: ""Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens ""
Carter said: ""It won't happen again."""
"Book said: ""Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.""
Carter said: ""What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.""
Book said: ""Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.""
Carter said: ""Johnny, what the fuck?""
Book said: ""Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it."""
"Book said: ""Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...""
Carter said: ""I hear you.""
Book said: ""Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass."""
"Book said: ""It's me.""
Carter said: ""Johnny! Where the hell have you been?""
Book said: ""Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?""
Carter said: ""Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.""
Book said: ""I'm coming.""
Carter said: ""Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense."""
"Carter said: ""You hear me?""
Book said: ""I hear you. I'll stay in touch.""
Carter said: ""That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?"""
"Book said: ""Where I'm at is maybe 1890.""
Carter said: ""Say again?""
Book said: ""Make that 1790."""
"Schaeffer said: ""You know where he is.""
Carter said: ""Wrong.""
Schaeffer said: ""You'd lie to protect him.""
Carter said: ""Probably."""
"Schaeffer said: ""You admit you're lying?""
Carter said: ""I admit I don't know where he is.""
Schaeffer said: ""You're the first one he'll contact.""
Carter said: ""He's got my number."""
"Schaeffer said: ""Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...""
Carter said: ""What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out..."""
"Elaine said: ""Did you find him?""
Schaeffer said: ""Not yet."""
"Schaeffer said: ""Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.""
Elaine said: ""He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!""
Schaeffer said: ""Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.""
Elaine said: ""Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!""
Schaeffer said: ""Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him ""
Elaine said: ""I don't know where he is.""
Schaeffer said: ""But... if you had to guess?"""
"Elaine said: ""Everything okay?""
Rachel said: ""Yes, thank you very much.""
Elaine said: ""John said you're Amish.""
Rachel said: ""Yes.""
Elaine said: ""Oh."""
"Rachel said: ""Good morning.""
Elaine said: ""You didn't have to...""
Rachel said: ""I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!""
Elaine said: ""Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John."""
"Rachel said: ""Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.""
Elaine said: ""You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?""
Rachel said: ""I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit."""
"Elaine said: ""What's so funny?""
Rachel said: ""Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.""
Elaine said: ""God, Fred...""
Rachel said: ""At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.""
Elaine said: ""No? Why not?""
Rachel said: ""You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.""
Elaine said: ""Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?"""
"Eli said: ""Who was that man?""
Rachel said: ""His name is John Book."""
"Eli said: ""Is the English dead?""
Rachel said: ""No...""
Eli said: ""Looks dead..."""
"Eli said: ""That has no place in this house.""
Rachel said: ""I know."""
"Eli said: ""Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws ""
Rachel said: ""We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!""
Eli said: ""Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.""
Rachel said: ""I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel."""
"Rachel said: ""Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.""
Eli said: ""Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter."""
"Eli said: ""How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?""
Rachel said: ""I have done nothing against the ordnung.""
Eli said: ""Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?""
Rachel said: ""I have committed no sin.""
Eli said: ""No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!""
Rachel said: ""That is idle talk.""
Eli said: ""Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!"""
"Rachel said: ""I am not a child.""
Eli said: ""You are acting like one!""
Rachel said: ""I will be the judge of that.""
Eli said: ""No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!""

Scarecrow said: ""Yes -- that's true.""
Dorothy said: ""But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.""
Scarecrow said: ""Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.""
Dorothy said: ""I don't blame you for that.""
Scarecrow said: ""But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?"""

Elektra said: ""My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.""
Bond said: ""How long has he been with you?""
Elektra said: ""Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?"""
"Bond said: ""Does this look familiar to you?""
Elektra said: ""Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life."""
"Elektra said: ""Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?""
Bond said: ""Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.""
Elektra said: ""If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third..."""
"Bond said: ""The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...""
Elektra said: ""Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.""
Bond said: ""I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.""
Elektra said: ""You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it."""
"Elektra said: ""I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.""
Bond said: ""Always wanted to see the upper lines.""
Elektra said: ""You dont take no for an answer, do you?""
Bond said: ""No."""
"Elektra said: ""Oh my God...were buried alive...""
Bond said: ""Were alright."""
"Elektra said: ""I cant stay here.""
Bond said: ""Youre not going to."""
"Elektra said: ""No!  It will cave in!""
Bond said: ""Its the only way out..."""
"Bond said: ""I cant stay.""
Elektra said: ""I know."""
"Elektra said: ""The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.""
Bond said: ""I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met."""
"Elektra said: ""What is it?""
Bond said: ""...you should rest."""
"Elektra said: ""James...""
Bond said: ""I have to go.""
Elektra said: ""Then take me with you.""
Bond said: ""No. Youll be safe here.""
Elektra said: ""I dont want to be safe!""
Bond said: ""I have to go to work."""
"Elektra said: ""Vodka martini.""
Bond said: ""Two. Shaken not stirred."""
"Bond said: ""What the hell are you doing here?""
Elektra said: ""Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?"""
"Bond said: ""If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.""
Elektra said: ""You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill."""
"Bond said: ""I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.""
Elektra said: ""Really?"""
"Elektra said: ""Surely you believe in living dangerously.""
Bond said: ""Not at that price. Time to surrender."""
"Elektra said: ""You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.""
Bond said: ""Shush."""
"Bond said: ""How did you survive?""
Elektra said: ""I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that."""
"Elektra said: ""Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?""
Bond said: ""A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?""
Elektra said: ""What are you talking about?""
Bond said: ""Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?""
Elektra said: ""...what?""
Bond said: ""We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me..."""
"Elektra said: ""Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?""
Bond said: ""You can drop the act, its over.""
Elektra said: ""I dont know what youre talking about!""
Bond said: ""I think you do."""
"Elektra said: ""How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.""
Bond said: ""He used your exact words.""
Elektra said: ""You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?"""
"Bond said: ""Im coming with you.""
Elektra said: ""You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now."""
"Elektra said: ""I could have given you the world.""
Bond said: ""Not interested."""
"Bond said: ""Wheres M?""
Elektra said: ""Soon shell be everywhere."""
"Bond said: ""All this, because you fell for Renard?""
Elektra said: ""Five more turns and your neck will break."""
"Elektra said: ""Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.""
Bond said: ""You turned Renard.""
Elektra said: ""Just like you...only you were even easier."""
"Bond said: ""So you killed your father.""
Elektra said: ""He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom."""
"Bond said: ""Was this all about the oil?""
Elektra said: ""It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!"""
"Elektra said: ""It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.""
Bond said: ""No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident."""
"Elektra said: ""Know what happens when a man is strangled?""
Bond said: ""Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die."""
"Bond said: ""One... last... screw?""
Elektra said: ""Oh James."""
"Bond said: ""Valentin Zukovsky.""
Zukovsky said: ""BondJamesBond. What brings you here?""
Bond said: ""You, of course. I need some information.""
Zukovsky said: ""Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...""
Bond said: ""Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.""
Zukovsky said: ""Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House."""
"Zukovsky said: ""See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?""
Bond said: ""How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?""
Zukovsky said: ""What?  This is not possible."""
"Bond said: ""If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.""
Zukovsky said: ""Where did you get this?""
Bond said: ""Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me."""
"Zukovsky said: ""That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.""
Bond said: ""How high up does this...arms dealing go?""
Zukovsky said: ""Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.""
Bond said: ""But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline."""
"Zukovsky said: ""What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?""
Bond said: ""Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.""
Zukovsky said: ""Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship."""
"Zukovsky said: ""Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?""
Bond said: ""Whats your business with Elektra King?""
Zukovsky said: ""I thought you were the one in her business.""
Bond said: ""She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?""
Zukovsky said: ""As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks."""
"Zukovsky said: ""That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!""
Bond said: ""You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard."""
"Bond said: ""Now...where were we?""
Zukovsky said: ""A rope!""
Bond said: ""No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?"""
"Zukovsky said: ""Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.""
Bond said: ""And the payoff on the tables?""
Zukovsky said: ""A special job.  A...a...a submarine."""
"Bond said: ""Wheres the sub going?!""
Zukovsky said: ""No!  Get me out!""
Bond said: ""This is too big for even you.  Where is it?""
Zukovsky said: ""This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!"""
"Zukovsky said: ""So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.""
Bond said: ""Where?""
Zukovsky said: ""Istanbul."""
"Zukovsky said: ""Mother of God.""
Bond said: ""The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea."""
"Zukovsky said: ""The Maidens Tower.""
Bond said: ""How appropriate.""
Zukovsky said: ""Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years."""
"Christmas said: ""What?""
Zukovsky said: ""To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet."""
"Zukovsky said: ""No! Bond!""
Christmas said: ""Bond!"""
"Christmas said: ""What is this place?""
Zukovsky said: ""Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit."""
"Zukovsky said: ""In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.""
Christmas said: ""What class sub does your nephew run?""
Zukovsky said: ""C-class."""
"M said: ""Ill send someone out.""
Elektra said: ""Could...could you come?"""
"M said: ""Perhaps this isnt the time...""
Elektra said: ""Please."""
"Elektra said: ""Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.""
M said: ""Your father...""
Elektra said: ""Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back."""
"Elektra said: ""Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.""
M said: ""Someone will come.""
Elektra said: ""Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead."""
"Elektra said: ""Warm.""
Renard said: ""Is it?"""
"Renard said: ""So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.""
Elektra said: ""How would you know?"""
"Renard said: ""Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.""
Elektra said: ""Of course..."""
"Renard said: ""He was a...good lover?""
Elektra said: ""What do you think?"""
"Renard said: ""This is the end.""
Elektra said: ""No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same."""
"Elektra said: ""Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?""
Renard said: ""Yes.  Au revoir..."""
"M said: ""Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.""
Tanner said: ""And expensive.  Cost three million plus."""
"M said: ""Do we have the range of Renards plane?""
Tanner said: ""Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...""
M said: ""Marvellous."""
"M said: ""The parcels in the post.""

Laurie said: ""Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!""
Dreiberg said: ""I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?""
Laurie said: ""I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .""
Dreiberg said: ""Old?""
Laurie said: ""Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.""
Dreiberg said: "". . . What?""
Laurie said: ""Pick a record.  I feel like dancing."""

Dreiberg said: ""Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial."""

Dreiberg said: ""One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared."""

Dreiberg said: ""Memory lane."""

Dreiberg said: ""-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check."""
"Dreiberg said: ""I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.""
Laurie said: ""Antarctica??""
Dreiberg said: ""Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.""
Laurie said: ""Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.""
Dreiberg said: ""You and me."""
"Laurie said: ""Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.""
Dreiberg said: ""Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract."""

Dreiberg said: ""What are you up to?""
Laurie said: ""Don't look.  Turn around."""

Laurie said: ""The costumes.  Am I right?"""
"Dreiberg said: ""No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.""

Laurie said: ""That's because --""

Gibbons said: ""The name's Gibbons. You were saying?""
Xander said: ""What is this place?""
Gibbons said: ""Looks like a diner.""
Xander said: ""Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a ""salesman"" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a ""trucker"", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I ""walked"" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?"""
"Gibbons said: ""Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.""
Xander said: ""That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?""
Gibbons said: ""Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.""
Xander said: ""Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.""
Gibbons said: ""It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.""
Xander said: ""A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.""
Gibbons said: ""Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. ""Many are called, few are chosen"", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?""
Xander said: ""..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.""
Gibbons said: ""Why is that?""
Xander said: ""Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.""
Gibbons said: ""Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.""
Xander said: ""Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.""
Gibbons said: ""You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.""
Xander said: ""Is that a fact?""
Gibbons said: ""Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.""
Xander said: ""You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.""
Gibbons said: ""You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests."""

Xander said: ""You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.""
Gibbons said: ""Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me."""
"Gibbons said: ""You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.""
Xander said: ""You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.""
Gibbons said: ""You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.""
Xander said: ""I'm not interested. I've already got a job.""
Gibbons said: ""You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.""
Xander said: ""I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.""
Gibbons said: ""That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge."""
"Xander said: ""Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?""
Gibbons said: ""There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.""
Xander said: ""What do I get out of it?""
Gibbons said: ""If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.""
Xander said: ""You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along."""
"Xander said: ""Not bad for a gimp.""
Gibbons said: ""What's with that ""X"" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're ""extreme""? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head."""
"Xander said: ""How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?""
Gibbons said: ""Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?""
Xander said: ""Yeah, I spy or I die."""
"Gibbons said: ""I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.""
Xander said: ""Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5."""
"Xander said: ""Up yours.""
Gibbons said: ""Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene."""
"Xander said: ""Is that all?""
Gibbons said: ""Just remember, I'll be watching."""
"Xander said: ""I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.""
Gibbons said: ""If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.""
Xander said: ""Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.""
Gibbons said: ""One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!""
Xander said: ""I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?""
Gibbons said: ""We're not after car thieves here.""
Xander said: ""What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.""
Gibbons said: ""That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.""
Xander said: ""Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?""
Gibbons said: ""My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...""
Xander said: ""I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out."""
"Gibbons said: ""You did say ""Ahab""? You're sure about that?""
Xander said: ""Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.""
Gibbons said: ""This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this ""Ahab"".""
Xander said: ""Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?""
Gibbons said: ""I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today."""
"Xander said: ""Thanks.""
Gibbons said: ""You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.""
Xander said: ""You ain't seen nothing yet."""
"Xander said: ""Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.""
Gibbons said: ""I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?""
Xander said: ""They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that ""classified"" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song ""Silent Night"" mean anything to you?""
Gibbons said: ""Yes it does.""
Xander said: ""Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.""
Gibbons said: ""Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.""
Xander said: ""Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?""
Gibbons said: ""Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.""
Xander said: ""Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.""
Gibbons said: ""Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.""
Xander said: ""We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill."""
"Gibbons said: ""Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.""
Xander said: ""I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?""
Gibbons said: ""You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.""
Xander said: ""But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.""
Gibbons said: ""Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.""
Xander said: ""Who says you're the good guys?"""
"Gibbons said: ""You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.""
Xander said: ""Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?""
Gibbons said: ""On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?""
Xander said: ""No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?""
Gibbons said: ""All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.""
Xander said: ""You're a jerk-off, you know that?"""
"Sam Tannick said: ""What do you have?""
Gibbons said: ""Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called ""Ahab"". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.""
Sam Tannick said: ""He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.""
Gibbons said: ""They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.""
Sam Tannick said: ""Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys""
Gibbons said: ""We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.""
Sam Tannick said: ""How will you fix it?""
Gibbons said: ""I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.""
Sam Tannick said: ""So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.""
Gibbons said: ""You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop."""
"Gibbons said: ""The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...""
Sam Tannick said: ""The scum of the Earth.""
Gibbons said: ""But programmable. And expendable.""
Sam Tannick said: ""I've seen enough. Turn it off."""
"Sam Tannick said: ""They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.""
Gibbons said: ""That's exactly why we need them."""
"Sam Tannick said: ""Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.""
Gibbons said: ""I think we should send him whatever he wants.""
Sam Tannick said: ""You what? A wire transfer of this size?""
Gibbons said: ""If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.""
Sam Tannick said: ""You're talking about a very expensive risk here.""
Gibbons said: ""He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.""
Sam Tannick said: ""Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?"""
"Sam Tannick said: ""Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.""
Gibbons said: ""So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that."""
"Jefe said: ""Whatchu doing here?""
Xander said: ""Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.""
Jefe said: ""That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard."""
"Jefe said: ""We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?""
Xander said: ""We're anti-social. We don't have any friends."""
"Xander said: ""We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.""
Jefe said: ""You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.""
Xander said: ""Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.""
Jefe said: ""Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?"""
"Kid said: ""What game is that?""
Xander said: ""Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called ""Anarchy 99"", they're the bad guy bosses.""
Kid said: ""Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.""
Xander said: ""You wanna check it out? Come here."""
"Xander said: ""Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.""
Kid said: ""Naturally."""
"Kid said: ""This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.""
Xander said: ""Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the ""Finger of God"". Assassination and weapons."""
"Xander said: ""Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it ""blood week"". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.""
Kid said: """"Anarchy"" 99""?""
Xander said: ""What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.""
Kid said: ""What weapons do you have?"""
"Xander said: ""Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.""
Kid said: ""What do you get if you finish?""
Xander said: ""Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.""
Kid said: ""Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.""
Xander said: ""Like what?""
Kid said: ""He gets to be the hero."""
"Petra said: ""Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.""
Xander said: ""I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max."""
"Petra said: ""Do you know what a wire transfer is?""
Xander said: ""Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.""
Petra said: ""My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.""
Xander said: ""Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.""
Petra said: ""So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife."""
"Xander said: ""If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?""
Petra said: ""Yorgi asked me to.""
Xander said: ""You do everything Yorgi says?""
Petra said: ""Go to hell.""
Xander said: ""It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?""
Petra said: ""Mind your business.""
Xander said: ""Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you."""
"Xander said: ""Where are you going?""
Petra said: ""Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.""
Xander said: ""I was invited. What's your story?""
Petra said: ""I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions."""
"Xander said: ""Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.""
Petra said: ""Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.""
Xander said: ""That right? Why's that?"""
"Petra said: ""Who are you?""
Xander said: ""We hung out last night, remember?""
Petra said: ""I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?""
Xander said: ""Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck."""
"Petra said: ""Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.""
Xander said: ""You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid."""
"Xander said: ""Hey, you're good.""
Petra said: ""Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.""
Xander said: ""That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?"""
"Petra said: ""I don't know what you're talking about.""
Xander said: ""The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.""
Petra said: ""Go to hell!""
Xander said: ""Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal."""
"Petra said: ""What are you?""
Xander said: ""I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?"""
"Petra said: ""That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.""
Xander said: ""I'm from L.A.""
Petra said: ""So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?""
Xander said: ""Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.""
Petra said: ""Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.""
Xander said: ""Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.""
Petra said: ""You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.""
Xander said: ""I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.""
Petra said: ""Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?""
Xander said: ""The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.""
Petra said: ""All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.""
Xander said: ""We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.""
Petra said: ""A beach named X? That I'd like to see.""
Xander said: ""So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?"""
"Petra said: ""They tell me you're an American agent.""
Xander said: ""What are you talking about?""
Petra said: ""There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.""
Xander said: ""It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.""
Petra said: ""Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.""
Xander said: ""If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.""
Petra said: ""That's alright, I'll figure something out.""
Xander said: ""Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down."""
"Petra said: ""I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.""
Xander said: ""They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now."""
"Xander said: ""So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?""
Petra said: ""No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.""
Xander said: ""We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?""
Petra said: ""There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.""
Xander said: ""What's that?""
Petra said: ""I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.""
Xander said: ""You're what? What the hell have you been doing?""
Petra said: ""I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.""
Xander said: ""I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger."""
"Petra said: ""No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.""
Xander said: ""Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.""
Petra said: ""Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.""
Xander said: ""When can I see you again?""
Petra said: ""You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?"""
"Petra said: ""Are you alright?""
Xander said: ""What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!""
Petra said: ""I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.""
Xander said: ""I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF."""
"Xander said: ""What are you doing with the Ivans?""
Petra said: ""I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now."""
"Xander said: ""Where are we going?""
Petra said: ""We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.""
Xander said: ""Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?""
Petra said: ""It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.""
Xander said: ""Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!""
Petra said: ""What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.""
Xander said: ""Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.""
Petra said: ""No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?""
Xander said: ""We can't leave now. We have to do something.""
Petra said: ""Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said."""
"Petra said: ""They left. To a fortress in the mountains.""
Xander said: ""We'll have to go after them.""
Petra said: ""Aren't you afraid?""
Xander said: ""A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.""
Petra said: ""I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.""
Xander said: ""You don't have to do that.""
Petra said: ""Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.""
Xander said: ""Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?""
Petra said: ""I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.""
Xander said: ""When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.""
Petra said: ""What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet."""
"Petra said: ""Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.""
Xander said: ""He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool."""
"Petra said: ""Yorgi and Kirill.""
Xander said: ""Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them."""
"Xander said: ""Did you do your homework?""
Petra said: ""If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.""
Xander said: ""Let's do this."""
"Xander said: ""Where's he headed?""
Petra said: ""He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there."""
"Xander said: ""Where'd the damn truck go?!""
Petra said: ""Go to the water, it's that way!"""
"Xander said: ""Toadies right behind.""
Petra said: ""Let me."""
"Xander said: ""You okay?""
Petra said: ""A piece of shrapnel hit me.""
Xander said: ""I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice."""
"Petra said: ""He's shut out the communication circuit!""
Xander said: ""You can't talk to it?""
Petra said: ""No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.""
Xander said: ""A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better."""
"Petra said: ""It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.""
Xander said: ""It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?""
Petra said: ""By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!""
Xander said: ""Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!"""
"Petra said: ""I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.""
Xander said: ""You can't welch on me now. We had a deal."""
"Petra said: ""What are you doing?""
Xander said: ""It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed."""
"Petra said: ""Nothing. He had two days.""
Yorgi said: ""Perhaps he is not all he says he is."""
"Petra said: ""What are you doing?""
Yorgi said: ""It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident."""
"Yorgi said: ""What was that for?""
Petra said: ""I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.""
Yorgi said: ""You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.""
Petra said: ""Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.""
Yorgi said: ""Viktor! Stay the course."""
"Petra said: ""The Peace conference...""
Yorgi said: ""Nice place to start, don't you think?"""
"Shavers said: ""Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.""
Xander said: ""That's would be me."""
"Shavers said: ""Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.""
Xander said: ""I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.""
Shavers said: ""Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.""
Xander said: ""Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.""
Shavers said: ""Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir."""
"Shavers said: ""Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.""
Xander said: ""They come in any other styles or colors?"""
"Shavers said: ""This is your standard dart gun.""
Xander said: ""That one I'm real familiar with."""
"Xander said: ""I think I'll hang on to these.""
Shavers said: ""Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list."""
"Xander said: ""From the Beastie Boys collection?""
Shavers said: ""It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.""
Xander said: ""You're joking, right?"""
"Shavers said: ""Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.""
Xander said: ""I thought that was in detail."""
"Xander said: ""Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...""
Sky said: ""I'm through, Xander.""
Xander said: ""I can see that. Why?""
Sky said: ""You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.""
Xander said: ""I'm having fun, what's the problem?""
Sky said: ""You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much ""integrity"" for that.""
Xander said: ""I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money..."""
"Sky said: ""French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?""
Xander said: ""Alright, so I'll get more.""
Sky said: ""It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.""
Xander said: ""Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now."""
"Sky said: ""What...?""
Xander said: ""I was gonna wait till the islands, but...""
Sky said: ""You're serious?""
Xander said: ""Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?""
Sky said: ""This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?""
Xander said: ""I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.""
Sky said: ""You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.""
Xander said: ""You're not exactly ""going anywhere"" yourself.""
Sky said: ""You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now."""
"Slovo said: ""Sit down.""
Xander said: ""I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand."""
"Slovo said: ""My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.""
Xander said: ""Here we go again.""
Slovo said: ""You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.""
Xander said: ""First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest."""
"Xander said: ""Nice hops.""
Slovo said: ""The corner. Anarchy 99."""
"Slovo said: ""I'll leave you two alone to talk.""
Xander said: ""Yeah, thanks a lot."""
"Xander said: ""Dude, what are you doing here?""
Slovo said: ""You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?"""
"Xander said: ""I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.""
Slovo said: ""Is this what you're looking for?"""
"Slovo said: ""Sorry, ""dude"".""
Xander said: ""What's the deal?""
Slovo said: ""Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?""
Xander said: ""Why you dogging me up?""
Slovo said: ""They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor."""
"Virg said: ""What's so damn funny?""
Xander said: ""Been to any good diners lately?"""
"Virg said: ""Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?""
Xander said: ""A parachute. This does not argue well."""
"Xander said: ""Who's writing this dude's dialogue?""
Virg said: ""He's a pretty good actor, though."""
"Xander said: ""Help me with this guy.""
Virg said: ""It's like you said, every man for himself."""
"Virg said: ""They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?""
Xander said: ""Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war."""
"Xander said: ""That's the guy.""
Yorgi said: ""This pizda? Never seen him before.""
Xander said: ""Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?"""
"Yorgi said: ""Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?""
Xander said: ""He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.""
Yorgi said: ""I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house."""
"Xander said: ""Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.""
Yorgi said: ""Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.""
Xander said: ""I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?"""
"Yorgi said: ""I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.""
Xander said: ""When else are you gonna do it?"""
"Yorgi said: ""We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?""
Xander said: ""Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start."""
"Yorgi said: ""Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.""
Xander said: ""It'll work faster if I have an account number."""
"Xander said: ""Very nice. I'm impressed.""
Yorgi said: ""I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem..."""
"Xander said: ""I had to inspect the merchandise first.""
Yorgi said: ""Of course."""
"Xander said: ""What's this?""
Yorgi said: ""This is a gift. From me to you."""
"Yorgi said: ""What's going on, my friend?""
Xander said: ""You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?""
Yorgi said: ""He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.""
Xander said: ""Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of."""
"Yorgi said: ""I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!""
Xander said: ""Had to do what I had to do."""
"Yorgi said: ""Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!""
Xander said: ""What's ""Anarchy 99""?""
Yorgi said: ""It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.""
Xander said: ""You wanna see my politics?"""
"Xander said: ""Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.""
Yorgi said: ""That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born."""
"Yorgi said: ""To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: ""America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free...""""
Xander said: """"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese"". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.""
Yorgi said: ""You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.""
Xander said: ""How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?""
Yorgi said: ""Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss."""
"Xander said: ""You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.""
Yorgi said: ""It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.""
Xander said: ""I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.""
Yorgi said: ""You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?""
Xander said: ""Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.""
Yorgi said: ""Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.""
Xander said: ""My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch."""
"Yorgi said: ""I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.""
Xander said: ""That's alright, I'm kinda tired.""
Yorgi said: ""You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one."""
"Yorgi said: ""That was for Anders.""
Xander said: ""Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run."""
"Yorgi said: ""And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?""
Xander said: ""I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.""
Yorgi said: ""Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is."""
"Xander said: ""What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.""
Yorgi said: ""You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.""
Xander said: ""So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.""
Yorgi said: ""Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.""
Xander said: ""Including rape, pillage, murder.""
Yorgi said: ""Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.""
Xander said: ""And here I thought ""anarchy"" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.""
Yorgi said: ""Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it."""
"Yorgi said: ""You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --""
Xander said: ""Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked."""
"Storm said: ""What does that mean?""
Beast said: ""The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions."""

Storm said: ""We all do.""

Beast said: ""I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro."""
"Beast said: ""It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.""
Cyclops said: ""Its core?"""
"Beast said: ""Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.""
Cyclops said: ""For what purpose?""
Beast said: ""Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.""
Cyclops said: ""So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?"""
"Jean said: ""Scott.. I -""
Cyclops said: ""I don't like him being here.""
Jean said: ""What are you talking about?""
Cyclops said: ""You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.""
Jean said: ""If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something."""
"Cyclops said: ""What's wrong with him?""
Jean said: ""His vital signs are weak and getting weaker."""
"Jean said: ""He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.""
Cyclops said: ""We have to find Magneto."""
"Jean said: ""Are you all right?""
Cyclops said: ""No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles."""
"Cyclops said: ""Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.""
Jean said: ""Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.""
Cyclops said: ""I'll tell you one thing though.""
Jean said: ""What's that?""
Cyclops said: ""He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him."""
"Cyclops said: ""Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.""
Jean said: ""Into the Hudson?""
Cyclops said: ""Uh-huh."""
"Cyclops said: ""I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?""
Jean said: ""It's too far.""
Cyclops said: ""Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here."""
"Cyclops said: ""Jean... can you?""
Jean said: ""I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough."""
"Logan said: ""Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?""
Cyclops said: ""I wanted to talk to you."""
"Cyclops said: ""How long have you been in Alaska?""
Logan said: ""I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?"""
"Logan said: ""I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?""
Cyclops said: ""You know, you --""
Logan said: ""Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men."""
"Logan said: ""I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.""
Cyclops said: ""Sure you are, sport."""
"Jean said: ""Anything else I can get you?""
Logan said: ""Some cigars.  Case of beer.""
Jean said: ""There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.""
Logan said: ""I won't light the cigars - how about that?""
Jean said: ""I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.""
Logan said: ""What if I like the pain?"""
"Jean said: ""The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.""
Logan said: ""Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.""
Jean said: ""Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.""
Logan said: ""By reading my thoughts?""
Jean said: ""If necessary.""
Logan said: ""What if they're naughty?"""
"Logan said: ""You should always work with a spotter.""
Jean said: ""He's busy right now."""
"Logan said: ""I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.""
Jean said: ""Were you now?""
Logan said: ""What do you say?""
Jean said: ""Not interested."""
"Jean said: ""Let go.""
Logan said: ""Suit yourself."""
"Logan said: ""He's uptight.""
Jean said: ""He takes his work seriously.""
Logan said: ""He takes himself seriously.""
Jean said: ""What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?"""
"Jean said: ""Logan, do you see this ring?""
Logan said: ""I've seen a lot of rings.""
Jean said: ""Yeah, I'll bet you have."""
"Kelly said: ""You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?""
Jean said: ""I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous."""
"Kelly said: ""Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?""
Jean said: ""Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --""
Kelly said: ""You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --""
Jean said: ""Control, Senator...  we teach them control."""
"Kelly said: ""This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -""
Jean said: ""I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.""
Kelly said: ""I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes."""
"Kelly said: ""Dr. Grey.""
Jean said: ""Senator?"""
"Kelly said: ""I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...""
Jean said: ""Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.""
Kelly said: ""Tell it to the ones that did this to me."""
"Jean said: ""The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.""
Kelly said: ""I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes."""
"Kelly said: ""You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?""
Magneto said: ""Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.""
Kelly said: ""You mutant bastards..."""
"Kelly said: ""Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.""
Magneto said: ""Gosh, I hope so."""
"Kelly said: ""The intention of registration act -""
Magneto said: ""INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth."""
"Kelly said: ""What is it you intend to do to me?""
Magneto said: ""Let's just say, God works too slowly."""
"Magneto said: ""I do love a good check mate.""
Logan said: ""What do you want?""
Magneto said: ""Come with me and I'll let her live.""
Logan said: ""You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here."""
"Logan said: ""Where am I?""
Magneto said: ""You're backstage at the encore of creation."""
"Logan said: ""What are you going to do?""
Magneto said: ""In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?"""
"Logan said: ""What am I doing here?""
Xavier said: ""I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.""
Logan said: ""Who?""
Xavier said: ""A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay."""
"Logan said: ""Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.""
Xavier said: ""Deal."""
"Xavier said: ""The point of what?""
Logan said: ""This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of ""team"" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?"""
"Xavier said: ""The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.""
Logan said: ""What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery."""
"Xavier said: ""Now that's Magneto talking.""
Logan said: ""No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.""
Xavier said: ""I believe he wants you for your Adamantium."""
"Logan said: ""Where are we going?""
Xavier said: ""To find Rogue.""
Logan said: ""How?""
Xavier said: ""The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being."""
"Logan said: ""You designed this yourself?""
Xavier said: ""Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.""
Logan said: ""He helped you?""
Xavier said: ""We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago."""
"Xavier said: ""I've found her, Westchester Mall.""
Logan said: ""I'll go."""
"Logan said: ""Don't you knock?""
Xavier said: ""They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?""
Logan said: ""Actually I'm feeling up to leaving."""
"Xavier said: ""Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...""
Logan said: ""What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here."""
"Logan said: ""Why is everybody up at sunrise?""
Storm said: ""The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.""
Logan said: ""What did she do to me?""
Storm said: ""She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.""
Logan said: ""I felt like she almost killed me.""
Storm said: ""If she held on any longer she could have.""
Logan said: ""And you think it helps calling her Rogue?"""
"Sabretooth said: ""I lost him.""
Magneto said: ""How?""
Sabretooth said: ""It was Xavier's people.  They knew."""
"Sabretooth said: ""Is that what you're looking for?""
Magneto said: ""A piece.  Only a piece.""
Sabretooth said: ""Is it enough?""
Magneto said: ""Enough for a test."""
"Sabretooth said: ""I'll find him.""
Magneto said: ""ALIVE."""
"Magneto said: ""I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.""
Xavier said: ""And I'll never understand terrorists.""
Magneto said: ""I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.""
Xavier said: ""Not at the cost of lives, Max."""
"Magneto said: ""The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?""
Xavier said: ""What do you want with him?"""
"Xavier said: ""Is that so?""
Magneto said: ""Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.""
Xavier said: ""You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?""
Magneto said: ""Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me."""
"Magneto said: ""If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.""
Xavier said: ""The way what is going to be?""
Magneto said: ""I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.""
Xavier said: ""What do you mean to do?"""
"Magneto said: ""This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.""
Xavier said: ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?"""
"Magneto said: ""I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...""
Xavier said: ""I know."""
"Magneto said: ""Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?""
Xavier said: ""It does indeed, Max.""
Magneto said: ""And what do you do when you wake up to that?""
Xavier said: ""I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble."""
"Anastasia said: ""Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?""
Cornelius Waldman said: ""Yes, my dear, he is.""
Anastasia said: ""And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?""
Cornelius Waldman said: ""He is the fifth leading authority in his field.""
Anastasia said: ""Oh, shit.""
Cornelius Waldman said: ""Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey."""
"Burgomeister said: ""Frederick Frankenstein?""
Freddy said: ""You have the wrong house.""
Burgomeister said: ""And who might you be?""
Freddy said: ""Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.""
Burgomeister said: ""The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?""
Freddy said: ""No!""
Burgomeister said: ""What was your grandfather's name?""
Freddy said: ""Victor Frankenstein."""
"Burgomeister said: ""Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?""
Freddy said: ""Ugly, vicious rumous."""
"Burgomeister said: ""They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?""
Freddy said: ""Poppycock!"""
"Freddy said: ""I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?""
Burgomeister said: ""Now wait a minute!"""
"Freddy said: ""Where did you get this cauliflower?""
Carlson said: ""From your office, sir.""
Freddy said: ""Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?""
Carlson said: ""Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.""
Freddy said: ""Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?"""
"Carlson said: ""No, sir.  It will never happen again.""
Freddy said: ""Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me."""
"Freddy said: ""Give him an extra dollar.""
Carlson said: ""Yes, sir."""
"Carlson said: ""Yes, sir.""
Freddy said: ""He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being."""
"Freddy said: ""Carlson!""
Carlson said: ""Yes, sir?""
Freddy said: ""Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.""
Carlson said: ""Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?""
Freddy said: ""... No!"""

Cornelius Waldman said: ""Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?""
Herr Falkstein said: ""Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.""
Cornelius Waldman said: ""What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?""
Herr Falkstein said: ""'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'"""
"Cornelius Waldman said: ""Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!""
